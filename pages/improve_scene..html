                        This scene sets up the characters well, but it is lacking in conflict. It is mostly just banter
                        and exposition. There is a hint of tension when Sidney flinches at the mention of gutting, but
                        this is quickly quelled by Stu's tactless explanation. The dialogue feels a bit forced at times,
                        especially when characters are making references to movies that seem unrelated to the
                        conversation. Overall, this scene could benefit from more purposeful conflict. Maybe throw in
                        some foreshadowing that hints at the danger to come. Additionally, it might be helpful to give
                        each character a clear goal or motivation in the scene. What are they trying to get out of their
                        conversation at the lunch table? What do they want from each other? The description of Sidney's
                        house at the end of the scene feels a bit shoehorned in. It seems like it's meant to establish a
                        creepy atmosphere, but it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the scene, which is mostly light
                        and bantering. In short, this scene has potential, but it needs more conflict and purposeful
                        action to keep the audience engaged.

                        <p>Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch. Crowded at one table
                            is the "gang". This consists of Sidney, Billy and Tatum.
                            <br> <br>
                            Next to Tatum, sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped
                            across her back. He's a Billy wannabe. Almost the jock, almost
                            handsome, almost cool. He tries way to hard.
                            <br> <br>
                            Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY. A tall and gangly kid
                            with no such Billy-like aspirations. A witty jokester who elevates
                            geek to coolness.

                                    One suggestion to improve this scene could be to add more suspense and tension by
                                    incorporating more foreshadowing of the killer's identity. For example, instead of
                                    just having the characters discuss the murders and their theories, maybe there could
                                    be subtle clues or hints that point to one of them potentially being the killer.

                                    Additionally, the dialogue between the characters could be tightened up to make it
                                    more natural and authentic. Some of the lines come across as forced and unnecessary,
                                    so removing those and focusing on the more important points of the conversation
                                    could make the scene flow better and feel more engaging.

                                    Finally, the scene could benefit from some visual details to help establish the
                                    setting and mood. Rather than just describing the school courtyard and Sidney's
                                    house, adding in specific details like the weather or the state of the surrounding
                                    environment could help set the tone for the scene and draw the viewer in more
                                    effectively.
