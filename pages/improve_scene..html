                        This scene sets up the characters well, but it is lacking in conflict. It is mostly just banter
                        and exposition. There is a hint of tension when Sidney flinches at the mention of gutting, but
                        this is quickly quelled by Stu's tactless explanation. The dialogue feels a bit forced at times,
                        especially when characters are making references to movies that seem unrelated to the
                        conversation. Overall, this scene could benefit from more purposeful conflict. Maybe throw in
                        some foreshadowing that hints at the danger to come. Additionally, it might be helpful to give
                        each character a clear goal or motivation in the scene. What are they trying to get out of their
                        conversation at the lunch table? What do they want from each other? The description of Sidney's
                        house at the end of the scene feels a bit shoehorned in. It seems like it's meant to establish a
                        creepy atmosphere, but it doesn't quite fit with the rest of the scene, which is mostly light
                        and bantering. In short, this scene has potential, but it needs more conflict and purposeful
                        action to keep the audience engaged.

EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD – LATER
                            
Students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch. Crowded at one table is the "gang". This consists of Sidney, Billy, and Tatum.
                            
Next to Tatum sits her boyfriend STUART, with his arm draped across her back. He's a Billy wannabe. Almost the jock, almost handsome, almost cool. He tries way too hard.
                            
Across the table is the fifth wheel, RANDY. A tall and gangly kid with no such Billy-like aspirations. A witty jokester who elevates geek to coolness.
                            
TATUM: Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
                            
STU: I don't know, they just did.
                            
RANDY: Because their bodies were gutted.
Sidney flinches.
                            
BILLY: Thanks, Randy.
                            
TATUM: They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.
                            
STU: Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
                            
TATUM: That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female – BASIC INSTINCT.
                            
RANDY: That was an ice pick. Not exactly the same.
                            
STU: Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
                            
TATUM: Or a man's mentality.
                            
SIDNEY (quiet, almost to herself): How do you gut someone?
                            
STU: You take a knife and slit from the groin to the sternum.
                            
Sidney shivers down to her soul. The whole table rolls their eyes at Stu.
                            
STU: What? She asked.
                            
BILLY: It's called tact, you fuckrag.
                            
STU: Sorry.
                            
RANDY: Remember in JAWS when they caught the wrong shark at first and Richard Dreyfuss cut it open to look for body parts and all they found was a license plate and all this white milky goo.
                            
Stu leans over and socks Randy in the arm.
                            
STU: You heard Billy. Shut the fuck up.
                            
SIDNEY: Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
                            
Stu's taken back, a little off guard.
                            
STU: For about two seconds.
                            
RANDY: Before she dumped him for Steve.
                            
Tatum turns to Stu, surprised.
                            
TATUM: I thought you dumped her for me.
                            
STU: I did. He's full of shit.
                            
RANDY: And are the police aware you dated the victim?
                            
STU (offended): What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
                            
RANDY: It would certainly improve your high school Q.
                            
TATUM: Stu was with me last night.
                            
RANDY: Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
                            
TATUM: Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
                            
RANDY: Working, thank you.
                            
TATUM: I thought Blockbuster fired you.
                            
RANDY: Twice.
                            
RANDY: I didn't kill anybody.
                            
BILLY: No one's saying you did.
                            
RANDY: Besides, (perfect Stu mimic) "Takes a man to do something like that."
                            
STU: I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
                            
RANDY (to Stu): Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
                            
TATUM (eyeing Sidney): Randy, you goon-fuck, I'm eating here.
                            
Stu nibbles at Tatum's neck.
                            
STU: Yeah, Randy, she's getting mad. I think you better liver alone.
                            
Stu cracks up at his own joke. The others just MOAN. Sidney is about to crawl out of her skin, trying hard to ignore it all.
                            
EXT. SIDNEY'S HOUSE – LATER
                            
A huge two-story country home with a spacious lawn.
                            
A yellow school bus stops in front of the house, and Sidney steps off.
                            
The house looks big and lonely as Sidney moves up the walk to the front door.

                                    One suggestion to improve this scene could be to add more suspense and tension by
                                    incorporating more foreshadowing of the killer's identity. For example, instead of
                                    just having the characters discuss the murders and their theories, maybe there could
                                    be subtle clues or hints that point to one of them potentially being the killer.

                                    more natural and authentic. Some of the lines come across as forced and unnecessary,
                                    so removing those and focusing on the more important points of the conversation
                                    could make the scene flow better and feel more engaging.
