                                <h4>Critique</h4>
                                <p> There are a few things to note about this scene. Firstly, the lack of dialogue and
                                    action makes it difficult to fully critique as a "scene" in the traditional sense.
                                    Instead, it reads more like a sequence of shots that establish the setting and
                                    introduce the main character.
                                </p>
                                <p> In terms of visual storytelling, the shots of the Colorado mountains and the V.W.
                                    car moving along the road effectively set up the remote and isolated location of the
                                    Overlook Hotel. The tracking shots also create a sense of movement and anticipation
                                    for the audience.
                                </p>
                                <p> The actual scene in the lobby of the hotel is relatively straightforward, with the
                                    dialogue serving mostly as exposition to establish Jack's character and his reason
                                    for being at the hotel. However, it is notable that there is some visual interest in
                                    the movement of the camera as it pans and tracks with Jack through the secretary's
                                    office and into Ullman's office. This helps to add texture and movement to a scene
                                    that is otherwise fairly static.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, while there may not be much to critique in terms of character development or
                                    plot progression, the scene does effectively set up the setting and tone of the film
                                    through striking visuals and camera movement.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Suggestions</h4>
                                <p> The main suggestion would be to streamline the opening mountain and road shots to
                                    make them more visually interesting and relevant to the story. One possibility could
                                    be to have a character or object of importance in the car, or to show some
                                    foreshadowing of the hotel's ominous presence in the landscape. Additionally, the
                                    dialogue in the interview scene could be tweaked to reveal more about Jack's
                                    character and motivations, as well as build tension or intrigue about the Overlook
                                    Hotel. Overall, the scene could benefit from more purposeful storytelling and
                                    character development.

                                    future. As the events at the hotel unfold, she becomes increasingly anxious and
                                    overwhelmed, trying to hold her family together despite growing tension. She
                                    eventually reaches a breaking point and becomes determined to protect herself and
                                    her son from Jack's dangerous behavior, showing immense courage in the face of
                                    danger and surviving the ordeal.</td>
                                <td>The character arc for Wendy feels a bit predictable and linear. While we see her
                                    become gradually more anxious and concerned, her transformation into a determined
                                    survivor feels abrupt and not fully earned. Additionally, some of her actions, like
                                    interrupting Jack and causing tension in their relationship, feel unnecessary and
                                    detract from her character's agency.</td>
                                <td>To improve the character arc for Wendy, consider making her struggle more with the
                                    decision to stay at the hotel and how it affects her family. Show more moments of
                                    her being proactive and taking action to protect herself and her son, rather than
                                    relying on others to save her. Also, consider removing some of the unnecessary
                                    conflict between her and Jack to make her character more consistent and focused.

                                    trying to be a good husband and father. As the film progresses, his mental state
                                    deteriorates, leading him to become more and more unhinged, ultimately turning into
                                    a sadistic killer who is possessed by the hotel's influence.</td>
                                <td>The character arc for Jack is well-done, showcasing the gradual descent into madness
                                    and his eventual possession by the hotel. However, it could have benefited from more
                                    exploration of his relationship with his son and how that contributes to his guilt
                                    and inner demons.</td>
                                <td>One suggestion for improving the character arc would be to delve more into Jack's
                                    past and his relationship with his abusive father, as this could provide more
                                    context for his struggles with alcoholism and anger. Additionally, exploring his
                                    relationship with Danny and how that affects his mental state could provide more
                                    depth to his character.</td>

                                <td>Halloran starts out as a friendly and wise chef who seems to have a mysterious
                                    connection with Danny and understands the dark history of the hotel. He is genuinely
                                    kind and cares about the well-being of others. As the story unfolds, he becomes more
                                    confident and knowledgeable, with a mysterious air about him. He is always caring
                                    and concerned for others and remains cool under pressure, determined to get to the
                                    hotel. However, his arc takes a tragic turn as he meets a gruesome end, serving as a
                                    reminder of the danger everyone is in at the hotel. </td>
                                One way to improve Halloran's character arc would be to give him a greater sense of
                                agency and have him play a more active role in the story. Perhaps he could have
                                discovered more about the history of the hotel and worked alongside Danny to uncover its
                                secrets. Alternatively, his death could have been used to further develop the characters
                                of Wendy and Danny, showing how they cope with the loss of someone who had become a
                                trusted friend and ally.
                                <td>While Halloran is an interesting and likable character, his arc ultimately feels
                                    incomplete due to his sudden and tragic death. It would have been more satisfying to
                                    see him play a larger role in the story and have his arc reach a more meaningful
                                    conclusion.</td>
