    It’s 1987. Coastal California. Silhouetted mountains, moonlit<br />
    sea. Lights twinkling near the shoreline.<br />
<br />
    We move closer to see the lights of the town of San Junipero.<br />
    Streetlights. Nightclubs and bars. Cars drifting up and down<br />
    the main street.<br />
<br />
    The vehicles date from 1987. There&#039;s a billboard advertising<br />
    the movie The Witches of Eastwick.<br />
<br />
    We move closer:<br />
<br />
<br />
2   EXT. BARKER STREET - CONTINUOUS                             2<br />
<br />
    This is San Junipero&#039;s main drag.<br />
<br />
    Along the sidewalk we follow YORKIE, a slightly awkward woman<br />
    in her early 20s, dressed so as not to stand out. Jeans.<br />
    Sweatshirt. She wears glasses with black rims.<br />
<br />
    She&#039;s looking around, a little like a tourist, taking in the<br />
    sights. There&#039;s a TV in a store window, showing a news<br />
    report. The sound is inaudible, but the anchor introduces a<br />
    clip of Ronald Reagan giving a speech about the Berlin Wall.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie looks at this for a moment until her attention is<br />
    snatched away by a voice, a young male voice.<br />
<br />
                        WES<br />
              Kelly, c&#039;mon...<br />
<br />
    Yorkie looks round. There&#039;s a couple striding along the<br />
    sidewalk. At least they look like a couple. The young man is<br />
    called WES -- he&#039;s conventionally dressed, in a baseball<br />
    jacket. The woman looks individual, almost arty. Intriguing.<br />
    Attractive. This is KELLY. She&#039;s walking a step ahead of Wes,<br />
    looking straight ahead, while he buzzes around her.<br />
<br />
                        WES (CONT’D)<br />
              Kelly--<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              I&#039;m still walking Wes.<br />
<br />
                        WES<br />
              We only got a couple of hours, you<br />
              know, so let&#039;s use it-<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              I am using it.<br />
<br />
    They walk through the door of a large bar / music venue<br />
    called TUCKER&#039;S.<br />
                                     BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;       2.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Yorkie looks up at the sign for the bar. Then at the door.<br />
    Gingerly, she pushes it open.<br />
<br />
<br />
3   INT. TUCKER&#039;S - CONTINUOUS                                     3<br />
<br />
    This place is a cavern. There&#039;s music playing on a sound<br />
    system somewhere. C&#039;est La Vie by Robbie Nevil or equiv.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie looks around. No sign of Kelly or Wes. It&#039;s bustling<br />
    in here. Everyone dressed in the fashions of the day; a real<br />
    mix of archetypes. Everything from preppy kids to prototype<br />
    goths. It&#039;s like the cast of every John Hughes movie blended<br />
    together.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie is a bit overwhelmed. She walks to a corner containing<br />
    a number of video arcade machines.<br />
<br />
    There&#039;s Rolling Thunder. Top Speed. Double Dragon.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie is drawn to Bubble Bobble, a platform game in which<br />
    the players control cartoon dragons that squirt bubbles.<br />
<br />
    She reaches into her pocket and seems almost surprised to<br />
    find some quarters in there. She drops one in the slot and<br />
    hits the 1 Player button.<br />
<br />
    We close in on the game screen. Catchy 8-bit music pipes up.<br />
    Black starlit backdrop. Two cartoon dragons and a whirlwind<br />
    of bubbles. And the following poorly-translated message:<br />
<br />
                      NOW, IT IS BEGINNING OF A<br />
<br />
                   FANTASTIC STORY!! LET&#039;S MAKE A<br />
<br />
                  JOURNEY TO THE CAVE OF MONSTERS!<br />
<br />
                              GOOD LUCK!<br />
<br />
    The game begins. Yorkie seems to know what she&#039;s doing.        </div>

                <b>Summary:</b> The scene introduces us to the main setting of the story, San Junipero, a town in Coastal California in the year 1987.

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	This scene sets the stage for the episode of Black Mirror "San Junipero." It effectively establishes the time period, location, and tone through visual cues such as the dated cars, billboard, and clothing. The introduction of Yorkie as the protagonist also sets up her character as awkward and withdrawn, which will become important later in the episode. The use of the Bubble Bobble arcade game as a motif adds a layer of nostalgia and reinforces the theme of escapism that runs throughout the episode. Overall, this scene effectively establishes the world of San Junipero and draws the viewer in.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             There are a few suggestions that could improve this scene. Firstly, the description of the setting could be more vivid and immersive to draw the reader into the world. Instead of just stating that it's "Coastal California", there could be more sensory details to describe the sea breeze, the smell of saltwater, and the sound of waves crashing. <br />
<br />
Secondly, there could be more description of Yorkie's emotions and thoughts as she explores San Junipero. Is she excited, nervous, or curious? How does she react to the fashions and music of the time period? This would help to establish her character and make her more relatable to the audience. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the dialogue between Wes and Kelly could be more distinct and memorable. Right now, their conversation is very typical and generic. Giving them more unique voices and personalities would make them more interesting and engaging to watch onscreen.</p>

<br />
    Shortly afterwards, a young guy called DAVIS spots Yorkie on<br />
    the Bubble Bobble machine. He&#039;s faintly nerdy. A bit like a<br />
    young Rick Moranis. He&#039;s holding a drink with a straw which<br />
    he seems ill-at-ease with. He&#039;s nodding his head in time to<br />
    the music, badly.<br />
<br />
    Moments later, he&#039;s standing beside her, watching her<br />
    progress over her shoulder. It takes him a while to pluck up<br />
    the courage to speak.<br />
<br />
                        DAVIS<br />
              You&#039;re good at this.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie doesn&#039;t look up.<br />

<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Thanks. I&#039;ve played it before.<br />
<br />
    Davis is thinking of something to say.<br />
<br />
                        DAVIS<br />
              It&#039;s got different endings<br />

              two player.<br />
<br />
    She&#039;s focussing on the game.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Uh-huh?<br />
<br />
                        DAVIS<br />
              Kind of the first game to do that.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie&#039;s just lost her last life.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Dammit.<br />
<br />
    Davis tries to interest her in the Top Speed cabinet.<br />
<br />
                        DAVIS<br />
                 (holding a quarter)<br />
              Oh. Do you want (to try) --?<br />
<br />
    Yorkie looks at the game. The racing game, depicts a red car<br />
    thundering along a highway. The vehicle spins out of control<br />
    in a shower of dust.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie stares at that for a moment -- it disturbs her. Then:<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Uh, no -- thank you -- sorry it&#039;s<br />
              not you. I&#039;m sort of...<br />
                 (she gestures around)<br />
              Just want to get my bearings.<br />
<br />
                        DAVIS<br />
              Uh okay. See you around.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie wanders off. Davis watches her leave, then drops a<br />
    quarter in Bubble Bobble.        </div>

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	Overall, this scene is effective in setting up the characters of Yorkie and Davis and establishing the setting of Tuckers. However, there are a few areas that could be improved upon.<br />
<br />
Firstly, it would be helpful to have more specific details about the characters' appearances and mannerisms to help the actors bring them to life on screen. While Davis is described as "faintly nerdy" and "a bit like a young Rick Moranis," it would be helpful to have more specific details about his clothing, hairstyle, and body language. The same goes for Yorkie - it would be helpful to have a better sense of what she looks like and how she carries herself.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the conversation between Davis and Yorkie feels a bit stilted and awkward. While this may be intentional to show that Davis is nervous and uncertain about how to approach her, it could be improved by giving them more specific things to talk about. Rather than simply commenting on her performance on the Bubble Bobble machine, Davis could ask her more specific questions about the game or try to find out more about her interests.<br />
<br />
Finally, the ending of the scene where Yorkie declines Davis' offer to play the Top Speed cabinet feels a bit abrupt and could be more clearly motivated. It's not entirely clear why the depiction of the red car spinning out of control on the screen disturbs her, and this could be clarified with more specific language or reactions.<br />
<br />
Overall, this scene does a good job of introducing the characters and setting up the dynamics between them, but could benefit from more specific details and a stronger sense of motivation for the characters' actions.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Here are a few suggestions to improve the scene:<br />
<br />
1. Start with a clear establishing shot of Tucker's bar, so viewers can get a sense of the environment. This will help ground the scene and make it feel more real.<br />
<br />
2. Instead of relying on physical descriptions to paint a picture of Davis, show us what he looks like. For example, you could describe the T-shirt he's wearing or the sticker on his laptop. This will help us visualize him more clearly.<br />
<br />
3. Add some conflict to the scene. Right now, it's just a friendly conversation between two strangers. Consider adding some tension – maybe Davis has ulterior motives for talking to Yorkie, or maybe she's on edge because she's hiding something.<br />
<br />
4. Give Yorkie a clearer motivation. What is she trying to accomplish in this scene? Is she looking for someone specific, or just killing time? If we understand her goals, we'll be more invested in her story.<br />
<br />
5. Consider adding some foreshadowing or symbolism. For example, the Bubble Bobble machine could represent the fleeting nature of life – just like the game, we only have a limited number of "lives" before we run out. This could tie in nicely with the themes of the overall film.</p>

<br />
    Yorkie now has a drink -- a Coke in a glass -- and is<br />
    wandering deeper into the bar, looking around. Heart and Soul<br />
    by T’Pau is playing.<br />
<br />
    She sits down at a table to people-watch.<br />
<br />
    Sipping her Coke, she checks out the comings-and-goings.<br />
    Young couples. Preening jocks. Cool kids.<br />

<br />
Suddenly Kelly walks past. She spots something in the<br />
distance, rolls her eyes a little, and abruptly sits down<br />
beside Yorkie. Yorkie looks at her, a little surprised.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (quietly)<br />
          Go along with whatever I say.<br />

                    KELLY<br />
             (cutting him off)<br />
          Last week was last week.<br />
             (indicating Yorkie)<br />
          I need to talk to my friend here,<br />
          okay? Haven&#039;t seen her in a while.<br />
<br />
Kelly puts a supportive arm round Yorkie. Yorkie is surprised<br />
but puts on a smile for Wes.<br />
<br />
Wes goes to speak but Kelly interrupts--<br />
<br />
                     KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Wes, she&#039;s sick. Like six months to<br />
          live sick.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Five, actually.<br />
<br />
Kelly looks at Yorkie, amused and impressed -- but then<br />
immediately having to hide this. She looks back at Wes.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          I need to catch up with her.<br />
          Private time.<br />
                                 BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;   5.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wes looks, considers protesting, then thinks better of it.<br />
<br />
                    WES<br />
          Okay. Okay.<br />
             (to Yorkie)<br />
          Hey I&#039;m sorry.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          That&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
                    WES<br />
             (to Kelly)<br />
          I&#039;ll see you around.<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Sure.<br />
<br />
The girls watch him leave.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Sorry for killing you. The whole<br />
          six months to live thing. Sorry --<br />
          five. Five was a nice touch.<br />
             (she holds her hand out)<br />
          Kelly.<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE<br />

          Yorkie<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Like the dog breed?<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
             (shy laugh)<br />
          Yeah.<br />
<br />
Kelly thumbs in the direction of Wes.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          He&#039;s not a bad guy. I feel kinda<br />
          bad. Met him at the Quagmire, so...<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          What&#039;s a Quagmire?<br />
<br />
Kelly looks at her. She decides Yorkie looks a little<br />
innocent.<br />

<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              If you don&#039;t already know what the<br />
              Quagmire is, you probably don&#039;t<br />
              want to know.<br />
<br />
    Kelly looks at Yorkie&#039;s empty glass.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT&#039;D)<br />
              You want another one?<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Uh, I&#039;m not sure --<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Yeah you do. Come on.<br />
<br />
    She stands up, beckons Yorkie to follow.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
              Do I have to tug your leash?<br />

    Yorkie smiles.        </div>

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	Overall, this scene flows well and sets up some important plot points. However, there are a few things that could be improved upon.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the dialogue feels a bit forced and exposition-heavy at times, particularly with Kelly's sudden mention of Yorkie's sickness and the Quagmire. It might have been more effective to reveal these details more subtly over time, rather than all at once in this one scene. <br />
<br />
Additionally, the scene could benefit from some more vivid description to help paint a picture of the setting and characters. For example, we are told that there are "young couples," "preening jocks," and "cool kids" in the bar, but we don't get a clear sense of what they look like or how they're behaving. <br />
<br />
Finally, while the interaction between Kelly and Yorkie is intriguing and sets up their relationship for the rest of the episode, the scene could use a little more tension or conflict to make it more engaging. As it stands, it reads as a relatively simple meet-cute with a few sprinkles of exposition. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is a solid scene that could be improved with sharper dialogue, more descriptive language, and a stronger sense of conflict.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Here are a few suggestions to improve the scene:<br />
<br />
- While the scene establishes the setting and introduces the characters, it could benefit from a stronger hook or inciting incident to make the audience more invested. Consider adding an obstacle or challenge for the characters to overcome, or a new piece of information that raises the stakes.<br />
<br />
- The dialog feels a bit on-the-nose, with Kelly explicitly instructing Yorkie to "go along with whatever I say." Perhaps find a more subtle way for Kelly to convey her intentions while keeping the audience curious as to what she's up to.<br />
<br />
- The exchange between Kelly and Wes could be more dynamic, with more tension or conflict. Instead of Wes giving up so easily, maybe he tries to convince Kelly to stay or reveals something about their past relationship.<br />
<br />
- The last interaction between Kelly and Yorkie feels a bit forced, with Kelly trying to establish a rapport without much organic buildup. Consider finding a more natural way for them to connect or bond over a shared interest or experience.</p>

<br />
    Yorkie now has a drink -- a Coke in a glass -- and is<br />
    wandering deeper into the bar, looking around. Heart and Soul<br />
    by T’Pau is playing.<br />
<br />
    She sits down at a table to people-watch.<br />
<br />
    Sipping her Coke, she checks out the comings-and-goings.<br />
    Young couples. Preening jocks. Cool kids.<br />

Suddenly Kelly walks past. She spots something in the<br />
distance, rolls her eyes a little, and abruptly sits down<br />
beside Yorkie. Yorkie looks at her, a little surprised.<br />

             (to WES)<br />

<br />
    A few moments later, the girls are at the bar, on bar stools.<br />
    Kelly leans forward to get the attention of the barman, who<br />
    has blonde hair. Walk Like An Egyptian is playing.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
                 (to barman)<br />
              Hey. Blondie?<br />
<br />
    Mock-offended, the barman points to himself.<br />
<br />
                        BARMAN<br />
              I&#039;m &quot;blondie&quot;?<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              You are. Jack and Coke, times two.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Oh no. Mine was just Coke.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                 (ignoring that, to barman)<br />
              Times two.<br />
<br />
    Blondie starts fixing the drinks. Kelly turns to Yorkie, and<br />
    looks at her slightly strangely.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              What are you doing?<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              I&#039;m ‘regarding’ you.<br />
                                BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;   7.<br />
<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Feel like I&#039;m being... analysed.<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Shhh.<br />
             (she&#039;s reached a<br />
                conclusion)<br />
          Why the glasses?<br />
<br />
Self-consciously, Yorkie touches her glasses.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT&#039;D)<br />
          I mean I like them, they totally<br />
          work on you, but do you need them?<br />
          I mean do you --<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Yeah the lenses don&#039;t do anything.<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Knew it.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I wore glasses back in school but I<br />
          guess now they’re kind of a comfort<br />
          thing --<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Old times&#039; sake.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          I’d figured they were kind of a<br />
          fashion statement --<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE<br />
          Really?<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          - but then the rest of your outfit<br />
          is... Not.<br />
<br />
Yorkie looks down at her clothes, a tad self-conscious.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Don&#039;t take that wrong. It’s<br />
          refreshing. I mean look around.<br />
          People try so hard to look how they<br />
          think they should look.<br />
<br />
The clientele do look like they&#039;re trying too hard.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Looks they probably saw in some<br />
          movie.<br />
<br />
Kelly lightly touches Yorkie&#039;s glasses.<br />
                                BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;     8.<br />
<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          But I like these. They’re<br />
          authentically you.<br />
<br />
Yorkie is shy.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          To be honest I think I wear them<br />
          for something to hide behind.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (dry)<br />
          Something transparent to hide<br />
          behind. Okay.<br />
<br />
Just then Blondie puts the drinks on the bar.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
             (to Blondie)<br />
          Thanks.<br />
             (to Yorkie)<br />
          Cheers.<br />
<br />
Yorkie clinks glasses and takes a sip. The taste of the Jack<br />
Daniel&#039;s makes her cough a little.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
             (coughing)<br />
          That&#039;s --<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (incredulous)<br />
          Never tasted it before?<br />
<br />
Yorkie doesn&#039;t answer at first. Sips more, a bit embarrassed.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          No. I just-- haven&#039;t had it in a<br />
          while. It&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Kelly is &#039;regarding&#039; her again.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Do you live here?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          No, but --<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          A tourist?<br />
<br />
Yorkie waves her head as though to say &quot;kind of yes, kind of<br />
no&quot;, uncertain how to answer.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          We&#039;ll go with tourist. So you&#039;re<br />
          new here?<br />
                                     BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;       9.<br />
<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              First night.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              First night! Well okay.<br />
<br />
    She clinks her glass against Yorkie&#039;s.<br />
<br />
    The music changes. The opening of What Have You Done For Me<br />
    Lately by Janet Jackson (or equiv). Kelly laughs and claps.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
              Oh my God! Ha!<br />
                 (laughing)<br />
              We HAVE to dance to this.<br />
<br />
    She takes a huge gulp of her drink.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              With each other?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
              Uh huh.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie glances at the dance floor. People uninhibited,<br />
    laughing, enjoying themselves. Then she looks back at Kelly.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Dance floors are not ‘me’.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Ah let’s not limit ourselves...<br />
<br />
    She takes Yorkie&#039;s hand and starts to lead her toward the<br />
    dance floor. Yorkie pulls back, hesitant.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
              I can’t-<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              My ass you can’t, c’mon--<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              I’ll look dumb and-<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Just follow my lead.<br />
<br />
    And she leads Yorkie toward the dance floor.        </div>

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	Overall, the scene is well-written with good dialogue and character development. The interaction between Kelly, the confident and outgoing character, and Yorkie, the shy and introverted character, is engaging and sets up their dynamic for the rest of the episode. The use of music sets a playful tone and adds to the scene's ambiance.<br />
<br />
One suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more action and sensory details to create a more vivid image of the setting and characters. For example, describing the bar's atmosphere, lighting, or the way the drinks taste and feel. This can help to immerse the audience in the scene and make it more relatable.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the scene could benefit from more conflict or tension. While the dialogue is well-written and entertaining, there is not much at stake for the characters. Adding a sense of urgency or consequence can help to create a more engaging scene. For example, if Kelly and Yorkie's interaction was interrupted by a disruptive patron or if dancing was a requirement for entrance into a VIP section, it would heighten the stakes and add more tension.<br />
<br />
Overall, the scene is well-written, but adding more sensory details and tension could elevate it further.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Overall, this scene is well-written and flows smoothly. One suggestion would be to add more physical cues to the characters' actions, as this can help bring the scene to life on the screen. For example, instead of just having Kelly say "Thanks" to the bartender, the script could include her reaching for the drinks and handing them to Yorkie, or taking a sip before clinking glasses with her. Similarly, when Kelly leads Yorkie to the dance floor, there could be descriptions of the music, the movements of the other dancers, and how the characters react to all of this. This will help the scene feel more dynamic and engaging to the audience. Additionally, it may be helpful to add some more context to these characters and their relationship, such as what led them to meet at this bar and what they are hoping to get out of their encounter. This can help add more depth and meaning to their conversations and interactions.</p>

          think they should look.<br />
<br />
The clientele do look like they&#039;re trying too hard.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Looks they probably saw in some<br />
          movie.<br />
<br />
Kelly lightly touches Yorkie&#039;s glasses.<br />
                                BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;     8.<br />
<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          But I like these. They’re<br />
          authentically you.<br />
<br />
Yorkie is shy.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          To be honest I think I wear them<br />
          for something to hide behind.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (dry)<br />
          Something transparent to hide<br />
          behind. Okay.<br />
<br />
Just then Blondie puts the drinks on the bar.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
             (to Blondie)<br />
          Thanks.<br />
             (to Yorkie)<br />
          Cheers.<br />
<br />
Yorkie clinks glasses and takes a sip. The taste of the Jack<br />
Daniel&#039;s makes her cough a little.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
             (coughing)<br />
          That&#039;s --<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (incredulous)<br />
          Never tasted it before?<br />
<br />
Yorkie doesn&#039;t answer at first. Sips more, a bit embarrassed.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          No. I just-- haven&#039;t had it in a<br />
          while. It&#039;s good.<br />
<br />
Kelly is &#039;regarding&#039; her again.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Do you live here?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          No, but --<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          A tourist?<br />
<br />
Yorkie waves her head as though to say &quot;kind of yes, kind of<br />
no&quot;, uncertain how to answer.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          We&#039;ll go with tourist. So you&#039;re<br />
          new here?<br />
                                     BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;       9.<br />
<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              First night.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              First night! Well okay.<br />
<br />
    She clinks her glass against Yorkie&#039;s.<br />
<br />
    The music changes. The opening of What Have You Done For Me<br />
    Lately by Janet Jackson (or equiv). Kelly laughs and claps.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
              Oh my God! Ha!<br />
                 (laughing)<br />
              We HAVE to dance to this.<br />
<br />
    She takes a huge gulp of her drink.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              With each other?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
              Uh huh.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie glances at the dance floor. People uninhibited,<br />
    laughing, enjoying themselves. Then she looks back at Kelly.<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Dance floors are not ‘me’.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Ah let’s not limit ourselves...<br />
<br />
    She takes Yorkie&#039;s hand and starts to lead her toward the<br />
    dance floor. Yorkie pulls back, hesitant.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
              I can’t-<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              My ass you can’t, c’mon--<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              I’ll look dumb and-<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Just follow my lead.<br />
<br />
    And she leads Yorkie toward the dance floor.          </div>

            7   INT. TUCKER&#039;S - DANCE FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER                    7<br />
<br />
    The chorus of the track is in full   swing. Kelly dances --<br />
    carefree. Yorkie is quite awkward.   Almost just standing,<br />
    watching. She looks around, trying   to vaguely move her<br />
    shoulders in time but it&#039;s painful   to watch. Kelly leans in.<br />
                                 BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;          10.<br />
<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
                 (raised voice over music)<br />
              Copy me!<br />
<br />
    She starts to perform a dance move, pretty much lifted from<br />
    Janet Jackson -- nothing too elaborate -- indicating Yorkie<br />
    should copy her.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie starts to follow suit. She’s getting better. Kelly<br />
    laughs and nods.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
              You got it!<br />
<br />
    Yorkie starts to smile. Hesitancy giving way to enjoyment.<br />
    Kelly shows her another move - she copies it -- and another.<br />
    It&#039;s almost like Simon Says.<br />
<br />
    Then Kelly ups her game, performs a more flamboyant, somewhat<br />
    provocative, writhing move.<br />
<br />
    Other people on the dance floor start to notice. They’re<br />
    enjoying the scene -- not in a malicious or mocking way --<br />
    but laughing appreciatively.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie can&#039;t match that. She glances around, self-conscious.<br />
    Kelly is oblivious. For a moment we hold on Yorkie as she<br />
    watches Kelly lost in the moment, enjoying the attention of<br />
    the other dancers.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie, a little sadly, backs away, then leaves.<br />
<br />
    Kelly doesn&#039;t notice at first. Then she looks around just in<br />
    time to see Yorkie leaving.        </div>

	Overall, this scene is well-written and enjoyable to read. The descriptions are clear and the dialogue is effective in conveying the emotions of the characters.<br />

In terms of character development, the scene does a good job of showing the contrast between Kelly and Yorkie's personalities and comfort levels on the dance floor. The moment where Yorkie backs away and leaves is poignant and effectively highlights her insecurity.<br />
<br />
However, it might be useful to explore the reasons behind Kelly's obliviousness to Yorkie's departure. Is it intentional disregard or simply being caught up in the moment? Adding some context to her actions could potentially deepen her character.<br />

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Overall, this scene is effective in establishing the dynamic between Kelly and Yorkie. However, there are a few suggestions that could enhance the scene:<br />
<br />
1. Emphasize the contrast between Kelly and Yorkie's dancing abilities more prominently. Right now, the description only hints at it, but it could be made more apparent visually through camera shots or editing.<br />
<br />
2. Increase the tension in the scene by introducing a conflict or obstacle for the characters to overcome. Perhaps Yorkie feels embarrassed by her dancing and wants to leave, but Kelly encourages her to stay and keep trying. Or, the provocative move Kelly performs is seen as offensive by some of the other dancers, causing Kelly and Yorkie to face backlash.<br />
<br />
3. Use visual and auditory cues to convey the mood of the scene. Right now, the only description of the music and audience reaction is that they are "in full swing" and "enjoying the scene." Adding more specific descriptions, such as the beat of the music or the laughter of the crowd, can create a more immersive experience for the reader or viewer.<br />
<br />
4. Consider adding more dialogue between Kelly and Yorkie to reveal their personalities and motivations. Right now, Kelly is the more dominant character, but we don't know what Yorkie is thinking or feeling beyond her hesitancy on the dance floor. By giving her more lines or inner thoughts, the audience can better understand her as a character.</p>

<br />
    Yorkie opens a fire door and exits the building - to discover<br />
    it&#039;s raining. She stays beneath the awning. Kelly emerges.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Hey. Why&#039;d you run away?<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Sorry -- I said I’m not much of a<br />
              dancer.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              No shit. Like a frightened horse on<br />
              a frozen lake back there.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie goes to walk off.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
              I&#039;m kidding.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie turns to look at her, an eyebrow raised.<br />

<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Half kidding.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          Sorry I pushed you into it.<br />
          Saturday night&#039;s once a week, it&#039;s<br />
          like no time, I get impatient.<br />
<br />
Yorkie sits down on a low wall (or equiv), with a sigh.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          It’s not that; everyone was<br />
          looking.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Looking-?<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE<br />
             (indicating the two of<br />
               them)<br />
          You know? Two girls, dancing.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Okay: one, folks are way less<br />
          uptight than they used to be, and<br />
          two, this is a party town, no-one’s<br />
          judging.<br />
<br />
Kelly looks down at herself, at her own body. Does a slightly<br />
ridiculous ‘sexy’ move.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Face it, if they were staring it’s<br />
          because I. Am. Bodacious.<br />
<br />
That makes Yorkie laugh a little.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          You’re stupid.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Thank you.<br />
<br />
Yorkie looks up at the night sky.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I&#039;ve never been on a dance floor<br />
          before.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Never? As in whole time you&#039;ve been<br />
          alive, never?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          Never.<br />

<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          What are you, like, Amish? That&#039;s<br />
          one sheltered existence you got<br />
          there.<br />
<br />
Yorkie shrugs.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          As far as my family&#039;s concerned I<br />
          can&#039;t do anything.<br />
<br />
Kelly sits down beside Yorkie.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Yeah. Well. No-one knows about even<br />
          half the shit I get up to.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          With your folks, it&#039;s from a place<br />
          of love, though right? They worry.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          They don&#039;t worry. Just the concept<br />
          of me enjoying myself... That would<br />
          blowwww their minds.<br />
<br />
Kelly looks at Yorkie for a moment. Yorkie is kicking her<br />
legs against the wall, absentmindedly. Kelly looks at her<br />
legs.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          What would you like to do? That<br />
          you&#039;ve never done?<br />
<br />
She sidles in, a little closer. Yorkie smiles, a little<br />
excited, a little shy.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Uh...<br />
             (looking up)<br />
          Oh so many things.<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          San Junipero&#039;s a party town. All up<br />
          for grabs.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          Midnight&#039;s two hours away.<br />
<br />
Kelly&#039;s inched in a little more. Yorkie is almost shaking<br />
now, with nerves and excitement.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          That&#039;s not long.<br />
<br />
Kelly brushes some hair away from Yorkie&#039;s neck. Then leans<br />
in and talks quietly, almost in her ear.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Why waste time sitting here?<br />

<br />
<br />
She puts her hand on Yorkie&#039;s inner thigh. Yorkie exhales, as<br />
if with vertigo.<br />
<br />
Then she abruptly stands up, very flustered.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I - uh -- I -- listen --<br />
<br />
Kelly isn&#039;t offended, immediately takes it with good grace.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          It&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          No, I mean --<br />
             (hand over eyes)<br />
          Dammit<br />
             (eyes open again -- trying<br />
               to get words out)<br />
          Look, I -- ah -- you seem --<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Really, it&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
             (babbling)<br />
          I&#039;m engaged. I have a fiancé.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          At your age?<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Yes. I know. Yes.<br />
<br />
Kelly is almost amused by Yorkie&#039;s embarrassed flustering<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
          He&#039;s a good guy. He&#039;s a nice guy.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />

          And is Greg here?<br />

          No he&#039;s --<br />

               else&quot;)<br />

          Elsewhere?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          Yeah.<br />

                    KELLY<br />
          Uh-huh.<br />

          You want to go to bed with me? We<br />
          could be back at mine like--<br />
<br />
She clicks her fingers.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I never did anything like that.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (smiling)<br />
          All the more reason.<br />
<br />
Yorkie agonizes for a moment.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I... You&#039;re nice. I can&#039;t.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (shrug)<br />
          Okay.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I can&#039;t. I-<br />
<br />
Kelly is still good-natured.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          I get it.<br />
<br />

          In this?<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          It&#039;s been great to meet you.<br />
<br />
She holds out her hand. To shake hands. Kelly looks at her<br />
hand, amused. Then shakes it.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Likewise.<br />
<br />
Then Yorkie turns and starts to walk away, quickly. Kelly<br />
watches her leave for a moment, still slightly amused.<br />

<br />
<br />
     We follow with Yorkie for a few moments, tight on her face,<br />
     as she strides away, through the rain, murmuring to herself.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
                  (to self)<br />
               Okay. Okay. Okay. Shit. Shit.<br />
<br />
     She stops. She looks up at the sky again. Closes her eyes.<br />
     Exhales. Opens her eyes again. Makes a decision.<br />
<br />
     She turns on her heel to look at Kelly. But she&#039;s not there.<br />
     Yorkie just catches a glimpse of Kelly walking back in<br />
     through the fire escape, the door closing behind her.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie hovers for a moment, then decides not to follow.<br />
<br />
     She turns around again and walks away, a little crushed.        </div>

	Overall, the scene is well-written and serves its purpose in advancing the story and providing character development. The dialogue feels natural and believable, and the scene successfully conveys the mixed emotions that Yorkie is experiencing.<br />
<br />
One thing that could be improved is the pacing of the scene. While it's important to give time for the characters to interact and build a connection, some of the dialogue could be trimmed down to keep the scene moving. Additionally, the scene could benefit from some visual elements to break up the dialogue and add some variety to the shot composition.<br />
<br />
Another minor issue is that some of the dialogue feels a bit on the nose in terms of exposition and character motivation. For example, when Kelly asks Yorkie what she wants to do, it feels like a setup for future plot developments rather than a natural conversation between characters.<br />
<br />
Overall, though, the scene effectively introduces the characters and sets up their relationship for the remainder of the episode. With some tweaks to pacing and dialogue, it could be even more effective.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Overall, the scene is well-written, but there are a few suggestions to improve the pacing and create more clarity for the audience:<br />
<br />
1. Utilize more specific descriptions. Instead of saying "low wall (or equiv)," describe the wall in more detail to create a clearer picture for the audience. The same goes for other settings in the scene.<br />
<br />
2. Consider adding more subtext to the dialogue. While the conversation between Kelly and Yorkie is enjoyable, there are opportunities to add layers to the conversation by including small details or hints at their motivations.<br />
<br />
3. Balance the tension and release. The scene could benefit from moments of heightened tension or rising stakes to create a stronger emotional arc for both characters.<br />
<br />
4. Use the setting to create a mood. While the rain and awning are briefly mentioned, there could be more descriptions of the environment and how it affects the characters. This can help establish tone and atmosphere for the scene.</p>

              <p><b>Suggestions:</b>Overall, the scene is well-written, but there are a few suggestions to improve the pacing and create more clarity for the audience:<br />
<br />
1. Utilize more specific descriptions. Instead of saying "low wall (or equiv)," describe the wall in more detail to create a clearer picture for the audience. The same goes for other settings in the scene.<br />
<br />
2. Consider adding more subtext to the dialogue. While the conversation between Kelly and Yorkie is enjoyable, there are opportunities to add layers to the conversation by including small details or hints at their motivations.<br />
<br />
3. Balance the tension and release. The scene could benefit from moments of heightened tension or rising stakes to create a stronger emotional arc for both characters.<br />
<br />
4. Use the setting to create a mood. While the rain and awning are briefly mentioned, there could be more descriptions of the environment and how it affects the characters. This can help establish tone and atmosphere for the scene.</p>

<br />
    Yorkie opens a fire door and exits the building - to discover<br />
    it&#039;s raining. She stays beneath the awning. Kelly emerges.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              Hey. Why&#039;d you run away?<br />
<br />
                        YORKIE<br />
              Sorry -- I said I’m not much of a<br />
              dancer.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY<br />
              No shit. Like a frightened horse on<br />
              a frozen lake back there.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie goes to walk off.<br />
<br />
                        KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
              I&#039;m kidding.<br />
<br />
    Yorkie turns to look at her, an eyebrow raised.<br />

                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Half kidding.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          Sorry I pushed you into it.<br />
          Saturday night&#039;s once a week, it&#039;s<br />
          like no time, I get impatient.<br />
<br />
Yorkie sits down on a low wall (or equiv), with a sigh.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          It’s not that; everyone was<br />
          looking.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Looking-?<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE<br />
             (indicating the two of<br />
               them)<br />
          You know? Two girls, dancing.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Okay: one, folks are way less<br />
          uptight than they used to be, and<br />
          two, this is a party town, no-one’s<br />
          judging.<br />
<br />
Kelly looks down at herself, at her own body. Does a slightly<br />
ridiculous ‘sexy’ move.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          Face it, if they were staring it’s<br />
          because I. Am. Bodacious.<br />
<br />
That makes Yorkie laugh a little.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          You’re stupid.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Thank you.<br />
<br />
Yorkie looks up at the night sky.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I&#039;ve never been on a dance floor<br />
          before.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Never? As in whole time you&#039;ve been<br />
          alive, never?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          Never.<br />

<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          What are you, like, Amish? That&#039;s<br />
          one sheltered existence you got<br />
          there.<br />
<br />
Yorkie shrugs.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          As far as my family&#039;s concerned I<br />
          can&#039;t do anything.<br />
<br />
Kelly sits down beside Yorkie.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Yeah. Well. No-one knows about even<br />
          half the shit I get up to.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          With your folks, it&#039;s from a place<br />
          of love, though right? They worry.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          They don&#039;t worry. Just the concept<br />
          of me enjoying myself... That would<br />
          blowwww their minds.<br />
<br />
Kelly looks at Yorkie for a moment. Yorkie is kicking her<br />
legs against the wall, absentmindedly. Kelly looks at her<br />
legs.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          What would you like to do? That<br />
          you&#039;ve never done?<br />
<br />
She sidles in, a little closer. Yorkie smiles, a little<br />
excited, a little shy.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Uh...<br />
             (looking up)<br />
          Oh so many things.<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          San Junipero&#039;s a party town. All up<br />
          for grabs.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          Midnight&#039;s two hours away.<br />
<br />
Kelly&#039;s inched in a little more. Yorkie is almost shaking<br />
now, with nerves and excitement.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          That&#039;s not long.<br />
<br />
Kelly brushes some hair away from Yorkie&#039;s neck. Then leans<br />
in and talks quietly, almost in her ear.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Why waste time sitting here?<br />

<br />
<br />
She puts her hand on Yorkie&#039;s inner thigh. Yorkie exhales, as<br />
if with vertigo.<br />
<br />
Then she abruptly stands up, very flustered.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I - uh -- I -- listen --<br />
<br />
Kelly isn&#039;t offended, immediately takes it with good grace.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          It&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          No, I mean --<br />
             (hand over eyes)<br />
          Dammit<br />
             (eyes open again -- trying<br />
               to get words out)<br />
          Look, I -- ah -- you seem --<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Really, it&#039;s okay.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
             (babbling)<br />
          I&#039;m engaged. I have a fiancé.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          At your age?<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Yes. I know. Yes.<br />
<br />
Kelly is almost amused by Yorkie&#039;s embarrassed flustering<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
          He&#039;s a good guy. He&#039;s a nice guy.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />

          And is Greg here?<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE<br />
          No he&#039;s --<br />

               else&quot;)<br />

                       KELLY<br />
          Elsewhere?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          Yeah.<br />

                    KELLY<br />
          Uh-huh.<br />

          You want to go to bed with me? We<br />
          could be back at mine like--<br />
<br />
She clicks her fingers.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I never did anything like that.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (smiling)<br />
          All the more reason.<br />
<br />
Yorkie agonizes for a moment.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I... You&#039;re nice. I can&#039;t.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
             (shrug)<br />
          Okay.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I can&#039;t. I-<br />
<br />
Kelly is still good-natured.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          I get it.<br />
<br />

<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          It&#039;s been great to meet you.<br />
<br />
She holds out her hand. To shake hands. Kelly looks at her<br />
hand, amused. Then shakes it.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Likewise.<br />
<br />
Then Yorkie turns and starts to walk away, quickly. Kelly<br />
watches her leave for a moment, still slightly amused.<br />

<br />
<br />
     We follow with Yorkie for a few moments, tight on her face,<br />
     as she strides away, through the rain, murmuring to herself.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
                  (to self)<br />
               Okay. Okay. Okay. Shit. Shit.<br />
<br />
     She stops. She looks up at the sky again. Closes her eyes.<br />
     Exhales. Opens her eyes again. Makes a decision.<br />
<br />
     She turns on her heel to look at Kelly. But she&#039;s not there.<br />
     Yorkie just catches a glimpse of Kelly walking back in<br />
     through the fire escape, the door closing behind her.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie hovers for a moment, then decides not to follow.<br />
<br />
     She turns around again and walks away, a little crushed.          </div>

<br />
     CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER<br />
<br />
     Golden hour. Amber light cast on mountains in the background<br />
     as the sun bows behind the ocean.<br />
<br />
     In a low-rise apartment block, a light is on. We close in<br />
     slightly.<br />

<br />
11   INT. YORKIE&#039;S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS               11<br />
<br />
     The room is small and sparsely decorated. Panic by The Smiths<br />
     is playing on a small tape deck.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie stands in front of a full length mirror, wearing<br />
     similar dowdy gear to last week. She’s looking at herself.<br />
     She takes off her glasses.<br />
<br />
     Next she’s trying on a dress. Magenta, figure-hugging. A<br />
     little like Whitney Houston in the video for I Wanna Dance<br />
     With Somebody.<br />
<br />
     She looks at herself and wrinkles her nose. It&#039;s not her.<br />
<br />
     A quick cut and she&#039;s trying another look. A pink dress, her<br />
     hair tied back. Not dissimilar to Ally Sheedy&#039;s makeover in<br />
     The Breakfast Club.<br />
<br />
     Again, she decides against it.<br />
<br />
     Next she&#039;s in the bathroom, looking closely into a cabinet<br />
     mirror at her face.<br />
                                     BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        16.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Her hair is slicked back, her face is now heavily made-up --<br />
     reminiscent perhaps of the &#039;band of supermodels&#039; in Robert<br />
     Palmer&#039;s Addicted to Love video.<br />
<br />
     She looks at her face. It&#039;s not her.<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
               No.<br />
<br />
     Finally she tries something else. A bit more confident, a bit<br />
     more glam than before, but still &quot;her&quot;. She puts on her<br />
     glasses.<br />

12   EXT. KELLY&#039;S PLACE - EARLY EVENING                            12<br />
<br />
     Meanwhile, elsewhere, Kelly is leaving a house -- a kind of<br />
     clapboard beach house -- and walking towards her car, a red<br />
     Jeep.<br />
<br />
     She climbs in, revs the engine.<br />
<br />
     Sign O&#039; The Times starts playing on the stereo.<br />
<br />
     She reverses out of the driveway and goes to drive forward,<br />
     but suddenly Wes is there, in the road.<br />
<br />
     She pulls a face. Not entirely unkind, but unimpressed and<br />
     impatient. She guns the engine and drives around him.<br />

     She taps the steering wheel in time.<br />

     Now it’s getting dark. Kelly&#039;s jeep rolls into the car lot<br />
     and pulls to a halt. She climbs out, locks the door, turns<br />
     around -- and there&#039;s Wes.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               What the hell, Wes?<br />

     She starts to head for the bar. Wes follows.<br />

               Look, okay, I know--<br />

	The scene has good pacing and uses visual cues to set the scene and mood. However, the dialogue could benefit from more subtlety and nuance. The conversation between Kelly and Wes feels overly scripted, and their motivations could be better developed to create a more authentic and complex dynamic.

             1. Consider adding more action and conflict to the scene between Yorkie and Kelly. While their actions and dialogue are clear, the scene could benefit from some more tension and stakes that will engage the audience.<br />
<br />
2. Think about adding more visual description that enhances the mood and atmosphere. The scene is at night, so consider using more descriptive language to convey the darkness and mystery of the environment.<br />
<br />
3. Consider adding more insight into the characters' emotions and motivations. While their dialogue is well-written, it can be strengthened by giving more insight into how they are feeling and what they are really thinking.<br />
<br />
4. Consider adding more thematic depth to the scene. What is the main message you want to convey to the audience through this scene? How can you use the visuals and dialogue to communicate that message in a way that engages viewers?</p>

     CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER<br />
<br />
     Golden hour. Amber light cast on mountains in the background<br />
     as the sun bows behind the ocean.<br />
<br />
     In a low-rise apartment block, a light is on. We close in<br />
     slightly.<br />

11   INT. YORKIE&#039;S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS               11<br />
<br />
     The room is small and sparsely decorated. Panic by The Smiths<br />
     is playing on a small tape deck.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie stands in front of a full length mirror, wearing<br />
     similar dowdy gear to last week. She’s looking at herself.<br />
     She takes off her glasses.<br />
<br />
     Next she’s trying on a dress. Magenta, figure-hugging. A<br />
     little like Whitney Houston in the video for I Wanna Dance<br />
     With Somebody.<br />
<br />
     She looks at herself and wrinkles her nose. It&#039;s not her.<br />
<br />
     A quick cut and she&#039;s trying another look. A pink dress, her<br />
     hair tied back. Not dissimilar to Ally Sheedy&#039;s makeover in<br />
     The Breakfast Club.<br />
<br />
     Again, she decides against it.<br />
<br />
     Next she&#039;s in the bathroom, looking closely into a cabinet<br />
     mirror at her face.<br />

<br />
     Her hair is slicked back, her face is now heavily made-up --<br />
     reminiscent perhaps of the &#039;band of supermodels&#039; in Robert<br />
     Palmer&#039;s Addicted to Love video.<br />
<br />
     She looks at her face. It&#039;s not her.<br />

<br />
     Living in a Box by Living in a Box is playing.<br />
<br />
     Kelly is at the bar. A dude called HARVEY, who looks like<br />
     he’s trying to emulate Miami Vice era Don Johnson but not<br />
     quite nailing it, sidles over to her. She looks up.<br />
<br />
                         HARVEY<br />
               Hey.<br />
<br />
     Kelly’s not too interested. But she’s polite.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Hey.<br />
<br />

                         KELLY<br />
               Not really.<br />
<br />
     Harvey sits beside her.<br />
<br />
                         HARVEY<br />
               Get you a drink?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Sure.<br />
<br />
     A small distance away, we find YORKIE, dressed in her regular<br />
     attire, watching Kelly, plucking up the courage to approach.<br />
     From Yorkie’s perspective, Kelly is listening to Harvey. When<br />
     we’re closer up, we can see Kelly is a tad bored. Harvey’s<br />
     saying stuff like:<br />
<br />
                         HARVEY<br />
               ... so it was micro-surgery I<br />
               guess, I mean both my kneecaps were<br />
               just kinda worn down...<br />

<br />
<br />
     Back to Yorkie. She seems to be exhaling, calming herself,<br />
     mentally counting down.<br />
<br />
     Then she starts walking over.<br />
<br />
     Meanwhile, Harvey has noticed the chorus to Living in a Box.<br />
<br />
                         HARVEY (CONT&#039;D)<br />
               Never got this song; kinda weird.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks around and spots Yorkie. She smiles and holds her<br />
     arm out to Harvey.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Shall we dance?<br />
<br />
                         HARVEY<br />
               Uh, sure --<br />
<br />
     She leads him toward the dance floor. Yorkie stops walking<br />
     and watches. As they approach the dance floor, Need You<br />
     Tonight by INXS comes on.<br />
<br />
     Kelly dances to the chorus. Aware she’s being watched.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie watches, wanting to walk over, and failing.<br />
<br />
<br />
16   INT. TUCKER&#039;S - BOOTH AREA - LATER                            16<br />
<br />
     Kelly sits in a booth with Harvey, while he talks sports.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie sits alone at a table across the way, with a drink.<br />
<br />
     The jukebox is playing Club Nouveau&#039;s cover of Lean On Me.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie glances over at Kelly. Kelly is looking at the table.<br />
     Yorkie looks back at her drink.<br />
<br />
     Then back at Kelly. This time Kelly is looking at her.<br />
     Sipping on a straw.<br />
<br />
     Flustered, Yorkie looks back down. Kelly smiles faintly.<br />
<br />
     She leans in to Harvey, interrupting him.<br />
<br />
                         HARVEY<br />
               ... I mean I guess if at the time<br />
               I&#039;d put that money into, like<br />
               computing, caught that first wave,<br />
               woulda been a different story -<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Gotta use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
     She stands up and walks toward the ladies restroom.<br />

<br />
<br />
     Across the way, Yorkie watches her go. Kelly glances at her<br />
     as she leaves.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie gets up.<br />
<br />
<br />
17   INT. TUCKER&#039;S - LADIES RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER             17<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s no-one else here. Kelly is standing in front of the<br />
     mirror checking her hair. Yorkie enters. She stands beside<br />
     her. Just stands there for a moment.<br />
<br />
     No-one says anything.<br />
<br />
     Then:<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               I don&#039;t know how to do this.<br />
<br />
     Kelly is still looking in the mirror. Mock innocent:<br />
<br />
                           KELLY<br />
               Do what?<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Just help me. Can you just --<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at her.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT&#039;D)<br />
               Can you make this easy for me?<br />
<br />
     Kelly touches her face.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               You want to get in my car?<br />
<br />
     Yorkie, looking at the floor, nods.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Then let&#039;s do that.        </div>

	Overall, the scene is written well with clear descriptions of the setting and characters' actions. However, there are a few areas that could be improved upon. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the dialogue between Harvey and Kelly is a bit flat and generic, which makes it difficult to really engage with their conversation. The writer could benefit from adding more depth or specificity to their exchange. <br />
<br />
Additionally, while the scene is able to establish Yorkie's interest in Kelly, it feels abrupt how Kelly goes from being mildly bored with Harvey to suddenly smiling and inviting Yorkie to dance. It could be helpful for the writer to include more build-up or tension between Kelly and Yorkie, rather than having their interaction feel so sudden. <br />
<br />
Finally, the final exchange between Kelly and Yorkie in the bathroom could benefit from more emotional weight or sense of danger, since Yorkie is essentially confessing her feelings to a stranger in a public restroom. Adding more tension or nuance to this conversation could heighten the stakes and make the scene more compelling.</p>

     Kelly looks at her.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT&#039;D)<br />
               Can you make this easy for me?<br />

     Kelly touches her face.<br />

     Kelly leads Yorkie out via the fire escape. Walks to the car.<br />

19   I/E. KELLY&#039;S CAR - FREEWAY - LATER                            19<br />
<br />
     Kelly is racing, at speed, down the freeway. A coastal road.<br />
     Yorkie winces slightly as they skid around a bend.<br />
<br />
                          KELLY<br />
                   (voice raised over the<br />
                     engine)<br />
                Relax. What&#039;s the worst that&#039;s<br />
                gonna happen?<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks out of the window. Then back at Kelly.<br />
<br />
                          YORKIE<br />
                How long have you been here?<br />
<br />
                            KELLY<br />
                Sorry?<br />
<br />
                          YORKIE<br />
                   (raised voice)<br />
                How long you been here?<br />
<br />
                          KELLY<br />
                In San Junipero?<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
                Yeah.<br />
<br />
                          KELLY<br />
                Ah...<br />
                   (thinking)<br />
                Couple months.<br />
                   (beat)<br />
                Plan is: long enough to enjoy<br />
                myself.<br />
                   (she looks at Yorkie)<br />
                Guess I&#039;m a tourist like you.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks out the window again.<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
                Yeah.<br />
<br />
     She looks a little troubled. Kelly can&#039;t see this. But after<br />
     a few beats she notices Yorkie is facing the other way.<br />
<br />
                            KELLY<br />
                Hey.<br />
<br />
     Nothing.<br />
<br />
                            KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
                You okay?<br />

                            YORKIE<br />

<br />
<br />
     Yorkie turns around. Kelly is looking straight at her, not<br />
     watching the road.<br />
<br />
     Suddenly Yorkie sees headlights coming straight for them.<br />
     Their car has drifted into the oncoming lane.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
               Shit!<br />
<br />
     Kelly quickly tugs the wheel, sending the car off the road,<br />
     along a dusty bank.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks terrified.<br />
<br />
     The car skids to a halt.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at Yorkie, who&#039;s ruffled, breathing fast.<br />
     Suddenly Kelly claps her hands, laughs once.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Sorry but --<br />
                  (laugh)<br />
               Man your face.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie laughs nervously.<br />
<br />
     Kelly starts the engine again.<br />
<br />
<br />
20   EXT. KELLY&#039;S HOUSE - LATER                                   20<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s jeep is parked outside her home. Kelly and Yorkie are<br />
     entering the front door.<br />
<br />
<br />
21   INT. KELLY&#039;S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                              21<br />
<br />
     They walk inside. Yorkie looks around. It’s a nice place.<br />
     Yorkie looks around a moment.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Wow.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               You like it?<br />
<br />
     Yorkie is looking around.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               It’s just so big -<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Reminds me of where I grew up.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie spots a small photo of a woman aged around 40 on a<br />
     mantelpiece. A photo of a dark-haired woman smiling, beneath<br />
     a handmade sign reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALISON.<br />
                                     BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        23.<br />
<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               With your mom?<br />
<br />
     Kelly gently turns Yorkie away from the photo, to face her<br />
     instead. Then she starts kissing Yorkie. After a moment&#039;s<br />
     hesitation, Yorkie reciprocates.<br />
<br />
<br />
22   INT. KELLY&#039;S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER                  22<br />
<br />
     It&#039;s dark in here. The two women lay down on the bed, Kelly<br />
     leading Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s hand moves to unbutton Yorkie&#039;s jeans.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
                  (breathless)<br />
               You&#039;ll have to show me --<br />
<br />
                            KELLY<br />
               Good.<br />
<br />
     They kiss passionately.        </div>

	Overall, the scene is well written and effectively advances the plot and character development. The pacing of the scene is strong, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The dialogue is natural and believable, with well-crafted individual character voices. However, the sudden shift from the car accident to the bedroom may be jarring for some viewers and could potentially detract from the emotional impact of the accident scene. Additionally, there may be a missed opportunity to further explore Yorkie's emotional state after the accident.

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Here are some suggestions for improving this scene:<br />
<br />
1. Establishing Shots: Consider adding establishing shots for Tucker's and the coastal road to create more context and add visual interest to the scene.<br />
<br />
2. Characterization: Develop the characterization of Kelly and Yorkie further. Why are they together? What do they want from each other? What motivates them?<br />
<br />
3. Dialogue: The dialogue can be more natural and nuanced. Yorkie's sudden questioning of Kelly's San Junipero history feels abrupt and forced. You can build this up more organically through conversation earlier in the scene.<br />
<br />
4. Tension: Build more tension in the car scene. Instead of simply throwing in a sudden car accident, you can ramp up the tension by adding more conflict or foreshadowing.<br />
<br />
5. Description: The description of the physical actions could use some improvement. Instead of simply stating that they lay down on the bed, describe the intimate touches and movements to heighten the sensuality of the moment.<br />
<br />
Overall, this scene has potential but can benefit from further development and revision for a smoother flow and heightened emotional impact.</p>

                In San Junipero?<br />

                            YORKIE<br />
                Yeah.<br />
<br />
                          KELLY<br />
                Ah...<br />
                   (thinking)<br />
                Couple months.<br />
                   (beat)<br />
                Plan is: long enough to enjoy<br />
                myself.<br />
                   (she looks at Yorkie)<br />
                Guess I&#039;m a tourist like you.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks out the window again.<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
                Yeah.<br />
<br />
     She looks a little troubled. Kelly can&#039;t see this. But after<br />
     a few beats she notices Yorkie is facing the other way.<br />
<br />
                            KELLY<br />
                Hey.<br />
<br />
     Nothing.<br />
<br />
                            KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
                You okay?<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
                Yeah.<br />

<br />
<br />
     Yorkie turns around. Kelly is looking straight at her, not<br />
     watching the road.<br />
<br />
     Suddenly Yorkie sees headlights coming straight for them.<br />
     Their car has drifted into the oncoming lane.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
               Shit!<br />
<br />
     Kelly quickly tugs the wheel, sending the car off the road,<br />
     along a dusty bank.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks terrified.<br />
<br />
     The car skids to a halt.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at Yorkie, who&#039;s ruffled, breathing fast.<br />
     Suddenly Kelly claps her hands, laughs once.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Sorry but --<br />
                  (laugh)<br />
               Man your face.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie laughs nervously.<br />
<br />
     Kelly starts the engine again.<br />
<br />
<br />
20   EXT. KELLY&#039;S HOUSE - LATER                                   20<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s jeep is parked outside her home. Kelly and Yorkie are<br />
     entering the front door.<br />

<br />
     They walk inside. Yorkie looks around. It’s a nice place.<br />
     Yorkie looks around a moment.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Wow.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               You like it?<br />
<br />
     Yorkie is looking around.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               It’s just so big -<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Reminds me of where I grew up.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie spots a small photo of a woman aged around 40 on a<br />
     mantelpiece. A photo of a dark-haired woman smiling, beneath<br />
     a handmade sign reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALISON.<br />

<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               With your mom?<br />
<br />
     Kelly gently turns Yorkie away from the photo, to face her<br />
     instead. Then she starts kissing Yorkie. After a moment&#039;s<br />
     hesitation, Yorkie reciprocates.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
     It&#039;s dark in here. The two women lay down on the bed, Kelly<br />
     leading Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s hand moves to unbutton Yorkie&#039;s jeans.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />

     Afterwards, they lie side by side in the darkness, looking up<br />
     at the ceiling.<br />

               That&#039;s not a critique. I mean that<br />
               was fucking awesome.<br />

                    KELLY<br />
          Yeah I’ll say.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a silence. They hold hands.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          When did you know? That you liked<br />

          Okay. But when did you know? Did<br />
          you always... know?<br />
<br />
Kelly looks at her. She doesn&#039;t usually open up to conquests.<br />
But there&#039;s something about Yorkie.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          I was married to a guy. A long time<br />
          I was married.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          I always &#039;knew&#039;, I mean, I would be<br />
          attracted to other girls, co-<br />

          who&#039;d serve me...<br />
             (she laughs at the memory)<br />
          There were crushes. My God were<br />
          there crushes.<br />
<br />
Her face hardens slightly.<br />

<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Never acted on any of it. Never did<br />
               anything. I was in love with him. I<br />
               really was in love with him.<br />

     This is hard for her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               But he chose not to stick around.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie slides closer. Strokes Kelly&#039;s hair. There are tears<br />
     glistening in Kelly&#039;s eyes now.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               So now it&#039;s me. And I&#039;m passing<br />
               through. And before I leave I&#039;ll<br />
               have a good time.<br />

               I&#039;m just gonna have a good time.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie leans over and gives her a kiss. Kelly is embarrassed,<br />
     possibly even annoyed by the vulnerability she&#039;s just<br />
     displayed.<br />
<br />
     She glances at a clock radio by the bed. It&#039;s 11:59 PM.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Time&#039;s nearly up.<br />

               Then let&#039;s lie here.<br />
<br />
     They lie, in the dark, without speaking, for a full fifteen<br />
     seconds.<br />
<br />
     The clock radio hits 12:00 AM and we cut abruptly to black.<br />

     The Witches of Eastwick billboard has been replaced by a<br />

<br />
     Yorkie, smiling, passes the store window with the TV in it.<br />
     There&#039;s a trail for the Max Headroom TV show on it.<br />

     Yorkie heads into the bar and looks around. There&#039;s no sign<br />
     of Kelly.<br />
<br />
     She explores the arcade section. No sign of her there either<br />
     (or DAVIS, come to that).<br />

<br />
     She checks out the booth area and the dance floor. Nope.<br />
<br />
     Finally she sits by the bar, sipping a Coke and looking<br />
     around. But Kelly&#039;s still not there.<br />
<br />
     I Wanna Dance With Somebody is playing, loudly.<br />
<br />
     Eventually she leans to speak to Blondie, the barman. Has to<br />
     shout to be heard.<br />

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	As a screenwriting expert, I would provide the following critique for this scene:<br />
<br />
Overall, this scene is well-written and effectively establishes the emotional and physical connection between Kelly and Yorkie. The dialogue is strong, and the characters' vulnerability allows for a deeper understanding of their past experiences and current motivations.<br />
<br />
However, there are a few areas where this scene could be improved. The dialogue between Kelly and Yorkie could be more nuanced and natural, especially in regards to Kelly's reveal about her past relationships and sexuality. While Kelly's story is powerful, it feels a bit rushed and could benefit from more exploration and character development.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the scene lacks much movement or action - there's a lot of talking and lying in bed, but not much else. Some more dynamic staging or visual elements could make this scene more engaging for viewers.<br />
<br />
Overall, this scene is solid but could benefit from some fine-tuning and added depth.</p>

1. Add more visual description: There are long stretches of dialogue without any description of what the characters are doing or the setting around them. Adding more visual details can help the audience connect with the characters and their environment.<br />
<br />
2. Build tension: There's no real conflict in this scene, which can make it feel flat. Adding some tension or suspense can make the scene more engaging. For example, if Kelly was hiding something from Yorkie or if they were being followed by someone who disapproved of their relationship.<br />
<br />
3. Develop the characters: While we get some backstory on Kelly, Yorkie is still something of an enigma. Adding more depth to both characters can make them feel more relatable and give the audience more reason to care about their relationship.<br />
<br />
4. Consider pacing: The scene is quite long, which can make it drag on. Breaking it up into smaller chunks with more action or changes in setting can help keep the audience engaged. <br />
<br />
5. Use the setting: The scene takes place in a bedroom and a bar, but the setting doesn't have much of an impact on the action. Using the setting to reflect or enhance the characters' emotional states can add more depth and interest to the scene.</p>

             <p> <b>Critique:</b>As a screenwriting expert, I would provide the following critique for this scene:<br />
<br />
Overall, this scene is well-written and effectively establishes the emotional and physical connection between Kelly and Yorkie. The dialogue is strong, and the characters' vulnerability allows for a deeper understanding of their past experiences and current motivations.<br />
<br />
However, there are a few areas where this scene could be improved. The dialogue between Kelly and Yorkie could be more nuanced and natural, especially in regards to Kelly's reveal about her past relationships and sexuality. While Kelly's story is powerful, it feels a bit rushed and could benefit from more exploration and character development.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the scene lacks much movement or action - there's a lot of talking and lying in bed, but not much else. Some more dynamic staging or visual elements could make this scene more engaging for viewers.<br />
<br />
Overall, this scene is solid but could benefit from some fine-tuning and added depth.</p>

     Afterwards, they lie side by side in the darkness, looking up<br />

<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Yeah I’ll say.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a silence. They hold hands.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          When did you know? That you liked<br />
          women?<br />
<br />

          Okay. But when did you know? Did<br />
          you always... know?<br />
<br />
Kelly looks at her. She doesn&#039;t usually open up to conquests.<br />
But there&#039;s something about Yorkie.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          I was married to a guy. A long time<br />
          I was married.<br />

          I always &#039;knew&#039;, I mean, I would be<br />

          who&#039;d serve me...<br />
             (she laughs at the memory)<br />
          There were crushes. My God were<br />
          there crushes.<br />
<br />
Her face hardens slightly.<br />

<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Never acted on any of it. Never did<br />
               anything. I was in love with him. I<br />
               really was in love with him.<br />
<br />
     This is hard for her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               But he chose not to stick around.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie slides closer. Strokes Kelly&#039;s hair. There are tears<br />
     glistening in Kelly&#039;s eyes now.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               So now it&#039;s me. And I&#039;m passing<br />
               through. And before I leave I&#039;ll<br />
               have a good time.<br />
                  (beat)<br />
               I&#039;m just gonna have a good time.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie leans over and gives her a kiss. Kelly is embarrassed,<br />
     possibly even annoyed by the vulnerability she&#039;s just<br />
     displayed.<br />
<br />
     She glances at a clock radio by the bed. It&#039;s 11:59 PM.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Time&#039;s nearly up.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Then let&#039;s lie here.<br />
<br />
     They lie, in the dark, without speaking, for a full fifteen<br />
     seconds.<br />
<br />
     The clock radio hits 12:00 AM and we cut abruptly to black.<br />

     CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER.<br />
<br />
     The Witches of Eastwick billboard has been replaced by a<br />
     poster promoting Spaceballs.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie, smiling, passes the store window with the TV in it.<br />
     There&#039;s a trail for the Max Headroom TV show on it.<br />
<br />
     She heads for Tucker&#039;s.<br />

25   INT. TUCKER&#039;S - CONTINUOUS                                 25<br />
<br />
     Yorkie heads into the bar and looks around. There&#039;s no sign<br />
     of Kelly.<br />
<br />
     She explores the arcade section. No sign of her there either<br />
     (or DAVIS, come to that).<br />

<br />
     She checks out the booth area and the dance floor. Nope.<br />
<br />
     Finally she sits by the bar, sipping a Coke and looking<br />
     around. But Kelly&#039;s still not there.<br />
<br />
     I Wanna Dance With Somebody is playing, loudly.<br />
<br />
     Eventually she leans to speak to Blondie, the barman. Has to<br />
     shout to be heard.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />

<br />
     Yorkie stands beside the road, almost the middle of nowhere.<br />
     She looks at a napkin in her hand, with a scribbled map on<br />
     it, given to her by the barman.<br />
<br />
     In front of her is a gate, with a dirt track behind it.<br />
     Beside it, on a small pole, is a sort of entry buzzer with<br />
     the word ‘QUAGMIRE’ where the residential name would be.<br />
<br />
     She pushes the button.<br />
<br />
                         INTERCOM VOICE<br />

               Uh, yeah -- I -<br />
<br />
     There’s a buzz. The gate is unlocked. She opens it and steps<br />
     through. In front of her, down the end of the track, in the<br />
     distance, she sees The Quagmire.<br />
<br />
<br />
27   EXT. THE QUAGMIRE - NIGHT                                    27<br />
<br />
     This must be the place. For one thing, it has a big neon sign<br />
     that says QUAGMIRE.<br />
<br />
     The Quagmire looks and sounds hard-core. Like a roadhouse<br />
     from an 80s action film mixed with a German techno club.<br />
     Harley Davidsons parked outside. You Gotta Fight For Your<br />
     Right To Party blaring from within.<br />
<br />
     Two men are making out in the back of a pickup truck parked<br />
     to one side.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks at all this, daunted. What the fuck?<br />
<br />
<br />
28   INT. THE QUAGMIRE - MOMENTS LATER                            28<br />
<br />
     Yorkie walks in and almost leaves immediately. The interior<br />
     of the club looks like a transgressive music video. There are<br />
     people dancing in cages. With snakes.<br />
<br />
     It’s steamy, transgressive and weird in here. Like walking<br />
     into the video for Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.<br />
<br />
     A man with a shaved bald head, wrapped in chains, wearing<br />
     nothing but a tight jockstrap, and pulling an absurdly<br />
     serious face, dances directly in Yorkie&#039;s path, like he<br />
     thinks he&#039;s a frickin&#039; art installation. She goes to step<br />
     round him and he dances in her way.<br />
<br />
     She steps the other way and he finally relents.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks around, in search of Kelly. This is part pick-up<br />
     joint, part fantasy-fulfilment dive bar. People making out in<br />
     the corners. Exploring / flaunting their sexuality any way<br />
     they can.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks at all this, daunted. What the fuck?<br />
<br />
     A couple sidle over to Yorkie. A man and a woman, both in<br />
     their mid-twenties. Both dressed as sailors.<br />

               Wanna have fun?<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               I&#039;m okay thanks.<br />
<br />
     She walks away. Now the music is Something Against You by The<br />
     Pixies.<br />
<br />
     It’s claustrophobic. Stuffed corridors. She finds herself<br />
     squeezing past more people. The further she ventures in, the<br />
     more warren-like it gets. At one point she passes a room in<br />
     which some kind of orgy seems to be taking place.<br />
<br />
     Then another area -- from the doorway, glimpsed over<br />
     shoulders, and between arms, she can see there’s some sort of<br />
     bare-knuckle fight going on. (NB no blood.)<br />

29   INT. THE QUAGMIRE - CONTINUOUS                                29<br />
<br />
     Yorkie turns away and almost walks straight into WES, who&#039;s<br />
     striding past clutching a bottle of beer.<br />
<br />
                            WES<br />

               No.<br />
<br />
     A beat. He looks at her. A penny drops for him.<br />
<br />

               You too, huh? Well --<br />
<br />
     He drinks his beer in a kind of toast.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks flat. This is no use. She&#039;s about to leave when<br />
     Wes takes pity on her.<br />
<br />
                         WES (CONT’D)<br />
               Try a different time. Seen her in<br />

                  (beat)<br />
               She&#039;s worth a shot, right?<br />
<br />
     He raises his bottle again. Yorkie turns toward the exit.<br />

     But on Barker Street, as the evening sun burns amber, earlier<br />

<br />
     Yorkie, exactly the same age, but dressed subtly differently,<br />
     her styling befitting the year 1980, strides past the store<br />
     with the TV in the window, which is showing a scene from the<br />
     Who Shot J.R? storyline in Dallas.<br />
<br />
     She heads purposefully for Tucker&#039;s.        </div>

<br />
     Yorkie stands beside the road, almost the middle of nowhere.<br />
     She looks at a napkin in her hand, with a scribbled map on<br />
     it, given to her by the barman.<br />
<br />
     In front of her is a gate, with a dirt track behind it.<br />
     Beside it, on a small pole, is a sort of entry buzzer with<br />
     the word ‘QUAGMIRE’ where the residential name would be.<br />
<br />
     She pushes the button.<br />

               Uh, yeah -- I -<br />
<br />
     There’s a buzz. The gate is unlocked. She opens it and steps<br />
     through. In front of her, down the end of the track, in the<br />
     distance, she sees The Quagmire.<br />
<br />
<br />
27   EXT. THE QUAGMIRE - NIGHT                                    27<br />
<br />
     This must be the place. For one thing, it has a big neon sign<br />
     that says QUAGMIRE.<br />
<br />
     The Quagmire looks and sounds hard-core. Like a roadhouse<br />
     from an 80s action film mixed with a German techno club.<br />
     Harley Davidsons parked outside. You Gotta Fight For Your<br />
     Right To Party blaring from within.<br />
<br />
     Two men are making out in the back of a pickup truck parked<br />
     to one side.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks at all this, daunted. What the fuck?<br />

<br />
     Funkytown by Lipps Inc pounds from the speakers as Yorkie<br />
     looks around. Everyone is dressed in the styles and fashions<br />
     of 1980.<br />
<br />
     But there&#039;s no sign of Kelly.<br />
<br />
     She walks past the arcade section, which features Pac Man,<br />
     Rally-X and Missile Command.<br />
<br />
     And there&#039;s DAVIS, the games nerd. He&#039;s styled like a young<br />
     Bill Gates, and has just completed a game of Battlezone when<br />
     he spots Yorkie.<br />
                                     BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        30.<br />
<br />
<br />
                          DAVIS<br />
               Hey.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie recognizes him.<br />
<br />
                          YORKIE<br />
               Oh, hey.<br />
<br />
     Davis indicates the Pac Man cabinet.<br />
<br />
                         DAVIS<br />
               Golden age, right?<br />
<br />
                          YORKIE<br />
               Right.<br />
<br />
     She&#039;s still looking around.<br />
<br />
                         DAVIS<br />
               You playing, or..?<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Sorry. Looking for someone.<br />
<br />
     Davis nods.<br />
<br />
                         DAVIS<br />
               Maybe next time?<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s a brief cut to black. Then:<br />
<br />
<br />
32   EXT. BARKER STREET - 1996 - NIGHT                             32<br />
<br />
     CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER<br />
<br />
     The billboard? Independence Day.<br />
<br />
     A &#039;96 Ford Contour slides by.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie -- again, the same age, but now styled almost like a<br />
     slacker - walks past the store, which now has a Sony<br />
     Trinitron in the window, relaying a news story about the<br />
     Atlanta Olympics.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks up at the Tuckers sign. Which has changed. It<br />
     looks more... 90s.<br />
<br />
<br />
33   INT. TUCKERS - CONTINUOUS                                     33<br />
<br />
     Full screen, we see part of the intro to the Namco arcade<br />
     game TIME CRISIS, which looks like an early Playstation<br />
     attempt to recreate the movie Die Hard. We pull out just as<br />
     Yorkie walks past.<br />
<br />
     Deeper into the bar, the music system is playing Killing Me<br />
     Softly by The Fugees.<br />
                                  BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        31.<br />
<br />
<br />
     In almost a shot for shot repeat of a scene we saw moments<br />
     ago, Yorkie seeks Kelly in the club. Everyone&#039;s dressed and<br />
     styled ala 1996.<br />
<br />
     Again she looks. Again no sign.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie sighs. No dice.<br />
<br />
<br />
34   EXT. KELLY’S HOUSE - LATER                                 34<br />
<br />
     Yorkie is standing outside Kelly’s house. The lights are off.<br />
<br />
     She looks through the window -- nothing.<br />
<br />
     Checks the door.<br />
<br />
     Stands back at a distance and calls up at the upper windows:<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Kelly!<br />
<br />
     Then louder.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
               Kelly!<br />
<br />
     But nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
35   EXT. BARKER STREET - 2002 - SUNSET                         35<br />
<br />
     CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s a billboard for The Bourne Identity.<br />
<br />
     A Chrysler PT Cruiser thrums past.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie -- styled for the era -- passes a shop window with a<br />
     widescreen TV showing footage from 2002.<br />
<br />
     Into Tuckers she goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
36   INT. TUCKERS - CONTINUOUS                                  36<br />
<br />
     The music system is blaring Can&#039;t Get You Out of My Head by<br />
     Kylie Minogue. (or Hot in Herrre by Nelly)<br />
<br />
     Yorkie scans the bar, the booths, the dance floor -- nothing.<br />
<br />
     She&#039;s walking out, past the arcade section, past a Namco<br />
     Dance Dance Revolution 7th Mix machine -- one of those huge<br />
     two-player &#039;dancing games&#039; where you step on pads on the<br />
     floor to progress - when she suddenly stops.<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s dancing on it. With Davis. Whose geeky look suddenly<br />
     seems quite chic.<br />
                                   BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;         32.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Yorkie walks over to watch as they dance to some hi-energy<br />
     Japanese pop.<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s doing well, as is Davis.<br />
<br />
     As the music comes to an end -- they&#039;re both awarded a GREAT!<br />
     ranking. Kelly high-fives Davis, and looks around.<br />
<br />
     She locks eyes with Yorkie. Looks unsure of herself for a<br />
     moment. Her smile drops. Then she turns to Davis.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Excuse me. Ladies&#039; room.<br />
<br />
     She starts to head off. Yorkie is in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
     By the restroom, she catches up with her.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               No. You wait a minute.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                  (irritated)<br />
               Why are you here?<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               I was looking for you. Where did<br />
               you go?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Felt like a change of music.<br />
<br />
     She starts fiddling with a Nokia 7650. Yorkie immediately<br />
     snatches it from her and throws it across the room.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               How the hell is this your era?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                  (pointing after phone)<br />
               I was looking at that.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               You hid from me.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               1) I did not, 2) I owe you zero and<br />
               3) see point 2.<br />
<br />
     She storms into the ladies restroom.        </div>

	Overall, this scene is well-written and effectively sets up the tension between Yorkie and Kelly. The use of music and cultural references is a great way to establish the time period and enhance the atmosphere of the setting. However, there could be more action and dialogue that directly advances the plot or reveals information about the characters. The ending, with Kelly storming off to the restroom, leaves the scene feeling unresolved. It may benefit from a clearer indication of what comes next or a stronger cliffhanger to keep the audience engaged.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             1. Give more context to the characters and their relationship early on in the scene. It's unclear who Kelly is and why Yorkie is looking for her. Establishing their connection would make the audience care more about the outcome of their interaction later on. <br />
<br />
2. Show more of Yorkie's emotional state throughout the scene. She's looking for someone important to her, but doesn't seem very distressed or heartbroken when she doesn't find them. Adding more physical actions or reactions, like her pacing around or looking more determined, would help convey her urgency and frustration. <br />
<br />
3. Consider adding some obstacles for Yorkie to overcome in her search. The scene is a straightforward sequence of her looking around and not finding Kelly. Adding in some other people or events that distract her or lead her on a wild goose chase would make the scene more dynamic and engaging. <br />
<br />
4. Make the dialogue more natural and specific to the characters. The conversation between Yorkie and Kelly feels generic and could be swapped out with any two people in any movie. Adding in more specific details about their history or personalities would give the dialogue more depth and authenticity. <br />
<br />
5. Set up the Nokia phone earlier in the scene to make it more impactful when Yorkie throws it. If we see Kelly using it or talking about it before the argument, it will feel like a more meaningful moment when it gets destroyed.</p>

     looks more... 90s.<br />
<br />
<br />
33   INT. TUCKERS - CONTINUOUS                                     33<br />
<br />
     Full screen, we see part of the intro to the Namco arcade<br />
     game TIME CRISIS, which looks like an early Playstation<br />
     attempt to recreate the movie Die Hard. We pull out just as<br />
     Yorkie walks past.<br />
<br />
     Deeper into the bar, the music system is playing Killing Me<br />
     Softly by The Fugees.<br />
                                  BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        31.<br />
<br />
<br />
     In almost a shot for shot repeat of a scene we saw moments<br />
     ago, Yorkie seeks Kelly in the club. Everyone&#039;s dressed and<br />
     styled ala 1996.<br />
<br />
     Again she looks. Again no sign.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie sighs. No dice.<br />
<br />
<br />
34   EXT. KELLY’S HOUSE - LATER                                 34<br />
<br />
     Yorkie is standing outside Kelly’s house. The lights are off.<br />
<br />
     She looks through the window -- nothing.<br />
<br />
     Checks the door.<br />
<br />
     Stands back at a distance and calls up at the upper windows:<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Kelly!<br />
<br />
     Then louder.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
               Kelly!<br />
<br />
     But nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
35   EXT. BARKER STREET - 2002 - SUNSET                         35<br />
<br />
     CAPTION: ONE WEEK LATER<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s a billboard for The Bourne Identity.<br />
<br />
     A Chrysler PT Cruiser thrums past.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie -- styled for the era -- passes a shop window with a<br />
     widescreen TV showing footage from 2002.<br />
<br />
     Into Tuckers she goes.<br />
<br />
<br />
36   INT. TUCKERS - CONTINUOUS                                  36<br />
<br />
     The music system is blaring Can&#039;t Get You Out of My Head by<br />
     Kylie Minogue. (or Hot in Herrre by Nelly)<br />
<br />
     Yorkie scans the bar, the booths, the dance floor -- nothing.<br />
<br />
     She&#039;s walking out, past the arcade section, past a Namco<br />
     Dance Dance Revolution 7th Mix machine -- one of those huge<br />
     two-player &#039;dancing games&#039; where you step on pads on the<br />
     floor to progress - when she suddenly stops.<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s dancing on it. With Davis. Whose geeky look suddenly<br />
     seems quite chic.<br />
                                   BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;         32.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Yorkie walks over to watch as they dance to some hi-energy<br />
     Japanese pop.<br />
<br />
     Kelly&#039;s doing well, as is Davis.<br />
<br />
     As the music comes to an end -- they&#039;re both awarded a GREAT!<br />
     ranking. Kelly high-fives Davis, and looks around.<br />
<br />
     She locks eyes with Yorkie. Looks unsure of herself for a<br />
     moment. Her smile drops. Then she turns to Davis.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Excuse me. Ladies&#039; room.<br />
<br />
     She starts to head off. Yorkie is in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
     By the restroom, she catches up with her.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               No. You wait a minute.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                  (irritated)<br />
               Why are you here?<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               I was looking for you. Where did<br />
               you go?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Felt like a change of music.<br />
<br />
     She starts fiddling with a Nokia 7650. Yorkie immediately<br />
     snatches it from her and throws it across the room.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               How the hell is this your era?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                  (pointing after phone)<br />
               I was looking at that.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               You hid from me.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               1) I did not, 2) I owe you zero and<br />
               3) see point 2.<br />
<br />
     She storms into the ladies restroom.          </div>

<br />
     Yorkie is right on Kelly&#039;s heels.<br />
                                  BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;          33.<br />
<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               It&#039;s not about who owes who, it&#039;s<br />
               about manners.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Hah!<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               You don&#039;t know who I am. You don&#039;t<br />
               know what this means.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                  (indicating &quot;the world&quot;)<br />
               This means fun. Or it should do.<br />
                  (indicating &quot;you and me&quot;)<br />
               And this. This is not fun. Okay.<br />
               This is not fun.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie stops fighting. Her eyes are wet.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Okay. Look. Don&#039;t (do that).<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               So you don&#039;t feel bad?<br />
<br />
     Kelly doesn&#039;t know what to say.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
               Maybe you should feel bad. Or at<br />
               least feel something.<br />
<br />
     She turns and leaves. Kelly sighs.<br />
<br />
     Turns and looks at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
     Then she punches the mirror, hard. It splinters. Shatters.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks down at her hand. No blood.<br />
<br />
     She looks at her reflection in the mirror, which is now<br />
     unharmed.<br />
<br />
<br />
38   EXT. TUCKERS - ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER                      38<br />
<br />
     The fire door is flung open as Yorkie stomps out. She paces<br />
     in a circle for a moment, upset and uncertain, not knowing<br />
     what to do.<br />
<br />
     She spots the fire escape, snaking up the side of the<br />
     building.<br />
<br />
<br />
39   EXT. TUCKERS - FRONT - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS                    39<br />
<br />
     Shortly afterwards, Kelly emerges from Tuckers, looking for<br />
     Yorkie. She looks around and can&#039;t see anything.<br />
                                    BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        34.<br />

<br />
                           KELLY<br />
               Yorkie?<br />
<br />
     She starts heading for the main street to see if she can find<br />
     her. All she can see is a couple, sitting on the hood of a<br />
     car, looking up at something high up, behind her. She paces<br />
     over to them.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               You seen a girl, mid-twenties,<br />
               brown hair, glasses?<br />
<br />
     The girl half of the couple just points up and behind Kelly.<br />
<br />
     Kelly turns. Standing on the roof of Tuckers, on the very<br />
     edge, is Yorkie, looking down at the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
                           KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Aw jeez.<br />
<br />
     As Kelly turns to head for the fire escape, the GIRL turns to<br />
     the GUY.<br />
<br />
                         GIRL<br />
               Why&#039;s she up there anyhow?<br />
<br />
     He shrugs a little.<br />
<br />
                         GUY<br />
               Newbie testing the boundaries.<br />
               Dumbasses pull that shit a lot.<br />
                  (he nudges her)<br />
               Not that I&#039;m against tourists.<br />
<br />
     The girl giggles.<br />
<br />
<br />
40   EXT. TUCKERS - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER                          40<br />
<br />
     Kelly clambers off the top of the fire escape. Yorkie is<br />
     sitting on the edge now, calmly, legs dangling over the side.<br />
<br />
     Kelly makes her way towards her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Please tell me you got your pain<br />
               slider set to zero.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie continues to stare out at San Junipero.<br />
<br />
                           YORKIE<br />
               Think so.<br />
<br />
     Kelly takes off her heels and sits down beside her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Okay, listen --<br />
                                    BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        35.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Yorkie cuts her off. Points down at the sidewalk, the people.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               How many of them are dead? Like<br />
               what percentage?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               As in full timers?<br />
                  (shrug)<br />
               Eighty. Eighty-five.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie nods.<br />
<br />
                            KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               I&#039;m sorry.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               I&#039;m not gonna jump--<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               I know, I&#039;m sorry whatever. It&#039;s --<br />
               in the time I&#039;ve been here --<br />
                  (sigh)<br />
               I&#039;m just visiting, you know? And<br />
               it&#039;s -- I didn&#039;t want to... I said<br />
               I wouldn&#039;t -- I don&#039;t know --<br />
               &#039;do&#039;... feelings...<br />
                  (beat)<br />
               You freaked me out.<br />
<br />
     She takes Yorkie&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               I don&#039;t want to &#039;like&#039; anyone. So<br />
               you&#039;ve been...<br />
                  (laughs gently)<br />
               ... just totally fucking<br />
               inconvenient.<br />
                  (beat; squeezes her hand<br />
                    harder)<br />
               Is that -- I mean --<br />
<br />
     Kelly is getting emotional now.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT&#039;D)<br />
               I don&#039;t know how long there is, and<br />
               I can&#039;t -- I -- I wasn&#039;t prepared<br />
               for this, for you, for wanting<br />
               something so--<br />

     Abruptly Yorkie turns to her, and they kiss passionately.        </div>

	The scene is well-written in terms of its emotional impact, but could benefit from more clear and concise dialogue. The characters are clearly struggling with their emotions and the concept of death in San Junipero, and this is conveyed effectively through their actions and reactions. However, some of the dialogue feels unclear and could be streamlined to better get across the characters' thoughts and feelings. Additionally, the scene could benefit from a clearer establishment of the setting and the characters' physical actions, as the audience may struggle to visualize some of the movements and gestures described. Overall, a strong scene with emotional resonance, but with room for improvement in terms of clarity and specificity.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Overall, the scene has good tension and character development, but it could be improved with some added specificity and clarity.<br />
<br />
- First, it might be helpful to establish where exactly Yorkie and Kelly are in Tuckers – are they at the bar, or in a side room? And are there other people in the restroom with them, or are they alone? This can help ground the audience in the physical space of the scene.<br />
<br />
- When Kelly punches the mirror, it might be helpful to include a bit of action or description to show the impact of the punch – does the glass completely shatter, or just crack? Do any other patrons in the restroom react to the noise?<br />
<br />
- In the transition from the restroom to the alleyway, it could be helpful to have a clearer sense of why Yorkie is upset and what she's thinking as she walks out. Is she angry at Kelly, or herself? Is she worried about the implications of their argument?<br />
<br />
- In the scene on the roof, it might be helpful to establish how Kelly climbs up the fire escape – does she struggle with it, or is it an easy ascent? And when Yorkie asks about the percentage of dead people in San Junipero, it might be helpful for Kelly to respond with a bit more emotional weight – does this question trigger a personal memory or fear for her? This could add more depth to her character.<br />
<br />
- Finally, the kiss between Yorkie and Kelly could be more impactful if it's built up a bit more gradually. Perhaps there could be more physical tension between them before the kiss – a touch on the shoulder, a nervous laugh, etc. – to signal the buildup of passion. <br />
<br />
Overall, these additions can help ground the scene in specific details and emotions, making it more memorable and impactful.</p>

             <p> <b>Critique:</b>The scene is well-written in terms of its emotional impact, but could benefit from more clear and concise dialogue. The characters are clearly struggling with their emotions and the concept of death in San Junipero, and this is conveyed effectively through their actions and reactions. However, some of the dialogue feels unclear and could be streamlined to better get across the characters' thoughts and feelings. Additionally, the scene could benefit from a clearer establishment of the setting and the characters' physical actions, as the audience may struggle to visualize some of the movements and gestures described. Overall, a strong scene with emotional resonance, but with room for improvement in terms of clarity and specificity.</p>

<br />
     Yorkie is right on Kelly&#039;s heels.<br />
                                  BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;          33.<br />
<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               It&#039;s not about who owes who, it&#039;s<br />
               about manners.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Hah!<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               You don&#039;t know who I am. You don&#039;t<br />
               know what this means.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
                  (indicating &quot;the world&quot;)<br />
               This means fun. Or it should do.<br />
                  (indicating &quot;you and me&quot;)<br />
               And this. This is not fun. Okay.<br />
               This is not fun.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie stops fighting. Her eyes are wet.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Okay. Look. Don&#039;t (do that).<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               So you don&#039;t feel bad?<br />
<br />
     Kelly doesn&#039;t know what to say.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
               Maybe you should feel bad. Or at<br />
               least feel something.<br />
<br />
     She turns and leaves. Kelly sighs.<br />
<br />
     Turns and looks at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
     Then she punches the mirror, hard. It splinters. Shatters.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks down at her hand. No blood.<br />
<br />
     She looks at her reflection in the mirror, which is now<br />
     unharmed.<br />
<br />
<br />
38   EXT. TUCKERS - ALLEYWAY - MOMENTS LATER                      38<br />
<br />
     The fire door is flung open as Yorkie stomps out. She paces<br />
     in a circle for a moment, upset and uncertain, not knowing<br />
     what to do.<br />
<br />
     She spots the fire escape, snaking up the side of the<br />
     building.<br />
<br />
<br />
39   EXT. TUCKERS - FRONT - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS                    39<br />
<br />
     Shortly afterwards, Kelly emerges from Tuckers, looking for<br />
     Yorkie. She looks around and can&#039;t see anything.<br />
                                    BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        34.<br />
<br />
<br />
                           KELLY<br />
               Yorkie?<br />
<br />
     She starts heading for the main street to see if she can find<br />
     her. All she can see is a couple, sitting on the hood of a<br />
     car, looking up at something high up, behind her. She paces<br />
     over to them.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               You seen a girl, mid-twenties,<br />
               brown hair, glasses?<br />
<br />
     The girl half of the couple just points up and behind Kelly.<br />
<br />
     Kelly turns. Standing on the roof of Tuckers, on the very<br />
     edge, is Yorkie, looking down at the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
                           KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Aw jeez.<br />
<br />
     As Kelly turns to head for the fire escape, the GIRL turns to<br />
     the GUY.<br />
<br />
                         GIRL<br />
               Why&#039;s she up there anyhow?<br />
<br />
     He shrugs a little.<br />
<br />
                         GUY<br />
               Newbie testing the boundaries.<br />
               Dumbasses pull that shit a lot.<br />
                  (he nudges her)<br />
               Not that I&#039;m against tourists.<br />
<br />
     The girl giggles.<br />
<br />
<br />
40   EXT. TUCKERS - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER                          40<br />
<br />
     Kelly clambers off the top of the fire escape. Yorkie is<br />
     sitting on the edge now, calmly, legs dangling over the side.<br />
<br />
     Kelly makes her way towards her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Please tell me you got your pain<br />
               slider set to zero.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie continues to stare out at San Junipero.<br />
<br />
                           YORKIE<br />
               Think so.<br />
<br />
     Kelly takes off her heels and sits down beside her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Okay, listen --<br />
                                    BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;        35.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Yorkie cuts her off. Points down at the sidewalk, the people.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               How many of them are dead? Like<br />
               what percentage?<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               As in full timers?<br />
                  (shrug)<br />
               Eighty. Eighty-five.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie nods.<br />
<br />
                            KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               I&#039;m sorry.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               I&#039;m not gonna jump--<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               I know, I&#039;m sorry whatever. It&#039;s --<br />
               in the time I&#039;ve been here --<br />
                  (sigh)<br />
               I&#039;m just visiting, you know? And<br />
               it&#039;s -- I didn&#039;t want to... I said<br />
               I wouldn&#039;t -- I don&#039;t know --<br />
               &#039;do&#039;... feelings...<br />
                  (beat)<br />
               You freaked me out.<br />
<br />
     She takes Yorkie&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               I don&#039;t want to &#039;like&#039; anyone. So<br />
               you&#039;ve been...<br />
                  (laughs gently)<br />
               ... just totally fucking<br />
               inconvenient.<br />
                  (beat; squeezes her hand<br />
                    harder)<br />
               Is that -- I mean --<br />
<br />
     Kelly is getting emotional now.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT&#039;D)<br />
               I don&#039;t know how long there is, and<br />
               I can&#039;t -- I -- I wasn&#039;t prepared<br />
               for this, for you, for wanting<br />
               something so--<br />
<br />
     Abruptly Yorkie turns to her, and they kiss passionately.          </div>

<br />
     Clock reads 11:55 PM. The decor in Kelly&#039;s room is slightly<br />
     different. 2002 style. There&#039;s a poster for the Salt Lake<br />
     City Winter Olympics on the wall.<br />
                                BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;   36.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bed is in disarray. We move toward the balcony.<br />
<br />
On the balcony, the women stand, Yorkie wrapped in a bed<br />
sheet, Kelly in just a man&#039;s white shirt. Hair ruffled. San<br />
Junipero in the distance. Kelly leaning over the side,<br />
smoking a cigarette. Yorkie breaks the silence.<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE<br />
          Can&#039;t believe I&#039;m getting married<br />
          next week.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Next week? To &#039;nice&#039; Greg. Sure<br />
          you&#039;re going through with that?<br />
<br />
                       YORKIE<br />
          I have to.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          You have to?<br />
<br />
Yorkie thinks for a moment.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          He really is a good guy. I mean my<br />
          family don&#039;t approve but they can&#039;t<br />
          stop us.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          I know he pities me, that pisses me<br />
          off, and that&#039;s not fair...<br />
<br />
Kelly kisses her cheek.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          Shhh.<br />
<br />
Yorkie thinks for a moment.<br />
<br />

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	Overall, the scene is written well and effectively conveys the characters' emotions and motivations. The dialogue between Kelly and Yorkie is engaging and dynamic, with both characters revealing their vulnerabilities and fears. This scene also provides important exposition about San Junipero and the concept of passing over. <br />
<br />
However, there are a few moments where the dialogue could be tightened or made more specific. For example, when Yorkie says "I mean my family don't approve but they can't stop us," it's unclear who "us" is referring to. Additionally, when Kelly asks "So -- you're gonna stay here? Pass over, go full time?" it's unclear what "pass over" means without context. <br />
<br />
Overall, though, the scene effectively develops the characters and sets up the conflict of Yorkie's impending marriage and Kelly's terminal illness.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             This scene is well-written and emotionally charged, but there are a few suggestions to improve it:<br />
<br />
- Consider adding more visual description to set the tone of the scene. What is the lighting like? Is there any music playing?<br />
<br />
- As the conversation between Kelly and Yorkie becomes more emotional, consider using shorter, more fragmented sentences to convey the intensity of the moment.<br />
<br />
- Consider adding more backstory about Kelly and Richard and their history with San Junipero. This would deepen the audience's understanding of the stakes involved.<br />
<br />
- Consider using blocking and physical action to convey the tension between Kelly and Yorkie. For example, Yorkie could take steps back from Kelly as she becomes more emotional, or Kelly could hug Yorkie to comfort her.<br />
<br />
Overall, the scene is well-written and engaging, but more sensory details and active blocking could heighten the emotional impact.</p>

smoking a cigarette. Yorkie breaks the silence.<br />

     Yorkie stares at her. Slowly, almost imperceptibly nods.<br />

<br />
     Outside a care home for seniors, a frail woman in her early<br />
     70s is being helped into a slightly futuristic-looking<br />
     vehicle by a kindly young nurse named Laura.<br />
<br />
                         LAURA<br />
               Okay Kelly... take my hand... Here<br />
               you go.<br />

<br />
43   I/E. DRIVERLESS VEHICLE - LATER                              43<br />
<br />
     As the nurse, Laura, sits reading some kind of translucent<br />
     tablet, ELDER KELLY (because yes, that&#039;s who it is), looks<br />
     out of the window, watching the scenery, a faint smile on her<br />
     lips.<br />
<br />
<br />
44   EXT. ST. BIRINUS HOSPITAL - LATER                            44<br />
<br />
     The vehicle has come to a halt outside a hospital in Santa<br />
     Rosa. Laura helps Kelly down the steps of the vehicle. A<br />
     doctor in his 30s holds out a hand to greet her.<br />
<br />
                         DOCTOR<br />
               You must be Kelly.<br />
<br />
                         ELDER KELLY<br />
               I guess I must.<br />
<br />
                         DOCTOR<br />
               She&#039;s waiting for you.<br />

45   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - LATER                                    45<br />
<br />
     The doctor leads Kelly to a small private room. He opens the<br />
     door for her, then waits outside the room.<br />
<br />
     We follow Kelly as she walks inside.<br />
<br />
     We can hear the soft beep of a monitoring device.<br />
<br />
     The percussive rise and fall of a mechanical ventilator.<br />
<br />
                         DOCTOR<br />
               She won&#039;t be able to physically<br />
               respond in any way, but she can<br />
               hear you.<br />
                  (beat)<br />
               I&#039;ll give you some privacy.<br />

<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks down. There, lying in bed, is an exceptionally<br />
     frail woman in her 60s.<br />
<br />
     Grey hair, and not much of it. She&#039;s in a neck brace. She<br />
     can&#039;t move. Her eyes are open. Her mouth is frozen in a blank<br />
     expression -- neither a smile nor a grimace. She&#039;s looking at<br />
     Kelly from her fixed position.<br />
<br />
     Kelly, for a moment, doesn&#039;t know quite what to do.<br />
<br />
     She walks nearer. Takes a seat beside the bed.<br />
<br />
     She looks at Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     Takes her hand.<br />
<br />
                            ELDER KELLY<br />
               Hi stupid.<br />
<br />
     She squeezes her hand.<br />
<br />
                         ELDER KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               It&#039;s good to see you.<br />
<br />
     She strokes Yorkie&#039;s hair and kisses her on the forehead.<br />
<br />
<br />
46   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATER                               46<br />
<br />
     A little later, Laura is helping Kelly along the corridor<br />
     when a kindly, overweight hospital porter named GREG (mid<br />
     40s), catches up with them.<br />
<br />
                         GREG<br />
                  (to KELLY)<br />
               Hi -- is it -- Kelly?<br />
<br />
                            ELDER KELLY<br />
               It is.<br />
<br />
     He holds out a hand.<br />
<br />
                            GREG<br />
               I&#039;m Greg.<br />
<br />
     Kelly stares at him for a moment.<br />
<br />
                         ELDER KELLY<br />
               You&#039;re Greg?<br />
                  (beat)<br />
               Well holy shit.<br />
<br />
                         GREG<br />
               You know I think it&#039;s great you<br />
               came in person before she passes<br />
               over; I mean even her folks don&#039;t<br />
               visit no more so --<br />
                                   BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;         41.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Kelly is shocked.<br />
<br />
                          ELDER KELLY<br />
                She&#039;s passing over?<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s a beat. Kelly looks lost in thought. Greg looks at<br />
     Laura -- &quot;what do I do?&quot; -- Laura looks back -- &quot;I don&#039;t<br />
     know&quot;.<br />
<br />
     Finally:<br />
<br />
                          ELDER KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
                When?<br />
<br />
     Greg waves an arm in the direction of the hospital canteen.<br />
<br />
                          GREG<br />
                Uh let&#039;s go grab a coffee.        </div>

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	The scene starts off strong by quickly setting the location and introducing the two main characters, Kelly and Laura. However, the dialogue between them feels a bit stiff and formal. Adding more natural and conversational language would make it feel more authentic.<br />
<br />
The transition to the driverless vehicle and the intro of the doctor feels smooth, but the description of the hospital and Kelly's sister, Yorkie, could have been conveyed more effectively. The description of Yorkie's physical state is effective in conveying her condition, but the dialogue between Kelly and Yorkie doesn't feel quite genuine, as it feels like it's lacking the emotional weight it should have.<br />
<br />
The reveal of Yorkie's fate is well done but feels a bit rushed and the pacing could have been improved to let the audience sit with the information for a bit longer. Lastly, the introduction of Greg feels abrupt and the dialogue, again, feels a bit too formal for what should be a more emotionally charged moment.<br />
<br />
Overall, the concept of the scene is interesting, but the execution could use some work in terms of natural dialogue and pacing.</p>

             To improve this scene, consider adding more emotional depth and conflict to the story. Perhaps Kelly is struggling with guilt or regret over not visiting Yorkie sooner, and this visit is an attempt to make amends. Also, give Yorkie some agency in the scene, even though she's unable to physically respond. Show her inner thoughts and emotions, or have her communicate through technology or gestures. This will make the scene more engaging and dynamic. Additionally, consider adding more descriptive language and sensory details to create a richer setting and atmosphere. Lastly, ensure that the dialogue and actions of the characters are authentic and believable.</p>

     expression -- neither a smile nor a grimace. She&#039;s looking at<br />
     Kelly from her fixed position.<br />
<br />
     Kelly, for a moment, doesn&#039;t know quite what to do.<br />
<br />
     She walks nearer. Takes a seat beside the bed.<br />
<br />
     She looks at Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     Takes her hand.<br />
<br />
                            ELDER KELLY<br />
               Hi stupid.<br />
<br />
     She squeezes her hand.<br />
<br />
                         ELDER KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               It&#039;s good to see you.<br />
<br />
     She strokes Yorkie&#039;s hair and kisses her on the forehead.<br />

<br />
     A little later, Laura is helping Kelly along the corridor<br />
     when a kindly, overweight hospital porter named GREG (mid<br />
     40s), catches up with them.<br />
<br />
                         GREG<br />
                  (to KELLY)<br />
               Hi -- is it -- Kelly?<br />
<br />
                            ELDER KELLY<br />
               It is.<br />
<br />
     He holds out a hand.<br />
<br />
                            GREG<br />
               I&#039;m Greg.<br />
<br />
     Kelly stares at him for a moment.<br />
<br />
                         ELDER KELLY<br />
               You&#039;re Greg?<br />

               Well holy shit.<br />

               You know I think it&#039;s great you<br />
               came in person before she passes<br />
               over; I mean even her folks don&#039;t<br />

<br />
     Kelly is shocked.<br />
<br />
                          ELDER KELLY<br />
                She&#039;s passing over?<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s a beat. Kelly looks lost in thought. Greg looks at<br />
     Laura -- &quot;what do I do?&quot; -- Laura looks back -- &quot;I don&#039;t<br />
     know&quot;.<br />

                I mean I only known her the past<br />
                three years. We talk on the combox.<br />
                She told you how she ended up<br />
                quadriplegic? And how long she&#039;s<br />

                So one night, she&#039;s 21 -- comes out<br />
                to her folks. They’re a little<br />
                ‘uptight’ about it you might say.<br />
                Tell her they don&#039;t want a gay<br />

          The hospital didn&#039;t have a<br />
          subscription -- some of us held a<br />

          year but we got the money.<br />

          Course till she passes over, goes<br />

It effectively conveys important information about the characters and the world they inhabit, with clear exposition delivered in a natural way that doesn't feel forced. The conversation flows smoothly and realistically, with appropriate beats and pauses that add depth to the dialogue. <br />
<br />
The character of Greg is an excellent example of how to write a character with natural, believable dialogue. He speaks in a conversational tone and shares his story in a way that feels organic and unforced. His backstory is revealed gradually, allowing the audience to build an understanding of his character in a way that feels realistic. <br />
<br />
Elder Kelly is similarly well-constructed, with her initial reticence gradually giving way to curiosity and a willingness to engage with Greg. Her wry humor and sardonic wit add depth to her character and make her an engaging presence on-screen. <br />
<br />
One element that could benefit from improvement is the physical description of the scene. While the dialogue is clear and effective, there is relatively little mention of the physical surroundings or the characters' actions beyond brief references to coffee cups and sandwiches. Adding more sensory details, such as descriptions of the smells and sights of the canteen area, would help to further immerse the audience in the scene and enhance its impact. <br />
<br />
Overall, this is a well-written scene with realistic, naturalistic dialogue that conveys a lot of important information about the characters and world of the story. With a few tweaks to the physical description, it could be even more effective.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             The scene is well-written and effectively conveys the backstory of Yorkie's life and her connection to the San Junipero system. Here are a few suggestions to make it even better:<br />
<br />
1. Show more emotion: Elder Kelly and Greg have a weighty conversation about life and death, but their delivery is somewhat flat. Add some emotional nuance to their dialogue to build empathy and increase the stakes for the audience.<br />
<br />
2. Cut down on exposition: The exposition in the scene is necessary to bring the audience up to speed on the plot, but it could be tightened up to make the conversation feel more organic. Instead of having Greg explain how the hospital acquired its San Junipero subscription, show it through action or dialogue in an earlier scene.<br />
<br />
3. Use the setting to enhance the mood: The hospital canteen is a banal location that doesn't contribute to the emotional tone of the scene. Consider setting the conversation in a more intimate or atmospheric location, such as Yorkie's hospital room, to heighten the sense of intimacy and emotional intensity.<br />
<br />
4. Create more conflict: The scene doesn't have much conflict beyond Elder Kelly's request to bend the rules for San Junipero access. Consider adding additional tension or sources of friction between the characters to give the scene more dynamism and raise the stakes.</p>

     Elder Kelly sits opposite Greg at a small table. They both<br />
     have trays in front of them. The detritus of snacks nearby.<br />
     Disposable coffee cups.<br />
<br />
                          GREG<br />
                She didn&#039;t tell you.<br />

                No.<br />

     Kelly stares down into her coffee. Greg fills the silence.<br />
<br />
                          GREG (CONT’D)<br />
                I mean I only known her the past<br />
                three years. We talk on the combox.<br />
                She told you how she ended up<br />
                quadriplegic? And how long she&#039;s<br />
                been that way?<br />
<br />
     Kelly’s face says no, she didn’t.<br />
<br />

                So one night, she&#039;s 21 -- comes out<br />
                to her folks. They’re a little<br />
                ‘uptight’ about it you might say.<br />
                Tell her they don&#039;t want a gay<br />

          It’s not natural and so forth. They<br />
          fight, she gets in her car, runs it<br />
          off the road. Boom.<br />
<br />
                    ELDER KELLY<br />
          When she was 21?<br />
<br />
                    GREG<br />
          More&#039;n 40 years back. It’s been her<br />
          whole lifetime basically.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          So the whole San Junipero system&#039;s<br />
          been a big deal for her. The<br />
          biggest deal.<br />
<br />
He takes a bite of sandwich.<br />
<br />
                    GREG (CONT’D)<br />
          The hospital didn&#039;t have a<br />
          subscription -- some of us held a<br />
          crowd-sourcing campaign. Took us a<br />
          year but we got the money.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          Course till she passes over, goes<br />
          permanent, she&#039;s got the five-hour<br />
          weekly limit - but I guess you&#039;re<br />

          trust us with more.<br />

                    GREG<br />
          I mean they say you go crazy if you<br />
          have too much. Never leave your<br />
          seat, disassociate your body from<br />
          your mind...<br />

Kelly is warming up slightly.<br />

Greg stops eating for a moment and looks at her.<br />

          That&#039;s not my problem incidentally.<br />

          You gotta have sign off from the<br />

          member. Stops people passing over<br />
          just &#039;cause they prefer San<br />
          Junipero flat out.<br />
<br />
Elder Kelly sardonically looks around the dowdy canteen.<br />
<br />
                    ELDER KELLY<br />
          Who&#039;d want to leave all this<br />
          wonder?<br />
<br />
Greg chuckles lightly.<br />
<br />
                    GREG<br />
          Heh. Anyhow Yorkie&#039;s family? Big<br />
          time religious. Don&#039;t come fuckin&#039;<br />
          see her -- pardon my tongue -- but<br />
          they&#039;re big time religious. And<br />
          they won&#039;t sign.<br />
<br />

<br />
     Kelly sits in a chair in the corner of the room, a box about<br />
     the size of a paperback book in her hands. She opens it up<br />
     and there&#039;s a small, extendable device within, something like<br />
     a cross between a set of earphones and a stethoscope.<br />
<br />
     Greg, meanwhile, is affixing an identical device to Yorkie, a<br />
     nodule touching her temple, in the bed.<br />
<br />
     He looks at Laura, the woman who accompanied Kelly here.<br />
<br />
                         GREG<br />
                  (to LAURA)<br />
               Ma&#039;am, watch the door.<br />
                  (to KELLY)<br />
               You got five minutes. No more.<br />
<br />
                            ELDER KELLY<br />
               Thank you.<br />
<br />
     Kelly positions the device in place and touches the button on<br />
     a small handheld controller.<br />
<br />
     A small blue LED embedded in the device nodule starts to<br />
     glimmer.<br />

49   EXT. KELLY&#039;S HOUSE - DAY                                      49<br />
<br />
     1987. It&#039;s Kelly&#039;s San Junipero house, during daylight hours.<br />
     She opens the door, and there, looking a little confused, is<br />
     Yorkie.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Hey. Over here. Hurry!<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks round.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />

               It&#039;s warm.<br />
<br />
     Kelly walks outside to join her. They hold hands and walk<br />
     along the sand.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               So I spoke to Greg.<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
               Uh-huh.<br />

               You&#039;re passing over tomorrow.<br />

               Couple hours after the wedding.<br />
                  (looks around)<br />
               So I guess technically I&#039;m<br />

               I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t tell y--<br />
<br />
     Kelly puts a finger to Yorkie&#039;s lips.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               I&#039;m gonna say something crazy.<br />
<br />
                            YORKIE<br />
               Okay.<br />
<br />
     Kelly goes down on one knee. Right there.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY<br />
               Wanna marry me instead?<br />
<br />
     Yorkie looks stunned.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               Just -- Greg seems great, but --<br />
               why not someone you&#039;ve... Connected<br />
               with...?<br />
<br />
     Yorkie drops down, and kisses her.<br />
<br />
                         KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
               That a yes?<br />

<br />
50   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY                             50<br />
<br />
     A pastor is reading the words of the marriage ceremony, as<br />
     Kelly sits beside Yorkie, holding her hand. Greg and Laura<br />
     look on.<br />

<br />
51   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - LATER                                  51<br />
<br />
     An official-looking member of staff holds out a translucent<br />
     tablet, with a consent form on it. Using her forefinger,<br />
     Kelly taps a consent box [for &#039;spouse&#039;]; her consent is<br />
     registered.<br />
<br />
     The official looks round at a doctor. Gives the nod.<br />
<br />
     In the bed, Yorkie is hooked up with the &#039;connector&#039; device.<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s also a new tube attached to her arm. The doctor holds<br />
     a syringe. He looks at Kelly.<br />
<br />
     Kelly, sitting beside Yorkie, is stroking Yorkie&#039;s hair. She<br />
     nods.<br />
<br />
     The doctor presses the syringe. An opaque white fluid travels<br />
     through the snaking pipe, into Yorkie&#039;s arm.<br />
<br />
     The winking LED on the connector starts to go into overdrive.<br />
<br />
     Close up on Kelly stroking Yorkie&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
     A screen indicates her vital signs have finished.<br />
<br />
     Greg draws a sheet over Yorkie&#039;s face.<br />
<br />

52   EXT. BEACH - LATER                                         52<br />
<br />
     It&#039;s a deserted beach. Daylight hours. A small cove. White<br />
     sand. Yorkie, alone, walks along the shore, closing her eyes<br />
     and feeling the warmth of the sun.<br />
<br />
     She picks up a stone and skims it into the water. Feels the<br />
     breeze and smiles. Sits down on the beach. Clenches and<br />
     unclenches her toes in the sand.<br />
<br />
     She removes her glasses. Looks at them for a moment and drops<br />
     them on the sand.<br />
<br />
     Looks up and watches the sea and the skies.<br />

<br />
53   EXT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - DAY                    53<br />

     The vehicle has drawn to a halt. Elder Kelly is being helped<br />
     out of the vehicle by Laura.<br />

<br />
54   INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - KELLY&#039;S ROOM - LATER     54<br />
<br />
     Elder Kelly, sitting in an armchair, is coughing -- painfully<br />
     and deeply.<br />
<br />
     With Laura&#039;s assistance she slips on the connector device and<br />
     sits back in her arm chair.<br />
<br />
     One more cough.<br />
<br />
                         LAURA<br />
               You sure you&#039;re alright?<br />
<br />
     Kelly nods, and indicates for Laura to hit the button. She<br />
     closes her eyes.        </div>

	As a screenwriting AI language model, I cannot determine the storytelling intention or creative choices of the screenwriter. However, I can observe technical aspects such as dialogue, camera direction, and pacing. The scene effectively conveys the emotional impact of passing over in San Junipero. The transition between the private room and Kelly's memory of marrying Yorkie is smooth and well-executed. The use of the LED nodule is a clear visual language that adds an interesting sci-fi element to the scene. The pacing is spot-on, creating a sense of urgency without feeling rushed. The dialogue is natural and poignant, especially Kelly's proposal to Yorkie. Overall, the scene is well-crafted and effectively conveys a crucial moment in the episode's plot.</p>

             One suggestion to improve this scene would be to add some emotional depth to it. While it is touching to see Kelly and Yorkie get married and Yorkie experience happiness on the deserted beach, it would be even more powerful to see the emotional impact of this moment for Elder Kelly. Perhaps we could see a flashback of her struggling with her own fears and doubts about the afterlife, and then cutting back to her putting on the device with a sense of relief and hope. This would add more layers to the scene and make it more poignant for the audience.</p>

     tablet, with a consent form on it. Using her forefinger,<br />
     Kelly taps a consent box [for &#039;spouse&#039;]; her consent is<br />
     registered.<br />
<br />
     The official looks round at a doctor. Gives the nod.<br />
<br />
     In the bed, Yorkie is hooked up with the &#039;connector&#039; device.<br />
<br />
     There&#039;s also a new tube attached to her arm. The doctor holds<br />
     a syringe. He looks at Kelly.<br />
<br />
     Kelly, sitting beside Yorkie, is stroking Yorkie&#039;s hair. She<br />
     nods.<br />
<br />
     The doctor presses the syringe. An opaque white fluid travels<br />
     through the snaking pipe, into Yorkie&#039;s arm.<br />
<br />
     The winking LED on the connector starts to go into overdrive.<br />
<br />
     Close up on Kelly stroking Yorkie&#039;s hand.<br />
<br />
     A screen indicates her vital signs have finished.<br />
<br />
     Greg draws a sheet over Yorkie&#039;s face.<br />
<br />
<br />
52   EXT. BEACH - LATER                                         52<br />
<br />
     It&#039;s a deserted beach. Daylight hours. A small cove. White<br />
     sand. Yorkie, alone, walks along the shore, closing her eyes<br />
     and feeling the warmth of the sun.<br />
<br />
     She picks up a stone and skims it into the water. Feels the<br />
     breeze and smiles. Sits down on the beach. Clenches and<br />
     unclenches her toes in the sand.<br />
<br />
     She removes her glasses. Looks at them for a moment and drops<br />
     them on the sand.<br />
<br />
     Looks up and watches the sea and the skies.<br />
<br />
<br />
53   EXT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - DAY                    53<br />
<br />
     The vehicle has drawn to a halt. Elder Kelly is being helped<br />
     out of the vehicle by Laura.<br />
                                  BLACK MIRROR &quot;SAN JUNIPERO&quot;          48.<br />
<br />
<br />
54   INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - KELLY&#039;S ROOM - LATER     54<br />
<br />
     Elder Kelly, sitting in an armchair, is coughing -- painfully<br />
     and deeply.<br />
<br />
     With Laura&#039;s assistance she slips on the connector device and<br />
     sits back in her arm chair.<br />
<br />
     One more cough.<br />
<br />
                         LAURA<br />
               You sure you&#039;re alright?<br />
<br />
     Kelly nods, and indicates for Laura to hit the button. She<br />
     closes her eyes.          </div>

<br />
     Yorkie stands by the side of the road, waiting.<br />
<br />
     Kelly pulls up in her 1987 jeep, I Need Love by LL Cool J on<br />
     the stereo. Her car has a bow on the front. She&#039;s wearing a<br />
     white wedding dress.<br />

     Yorkie laughs and claps her hands.<br />

     and sparking off the road.        </div>

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	Overall, this scene is well-written and engaging. The characters' dialogue is natural and feels authentic, and the detail of the tin cans bouncing off the road adds a nice touch of visual interest.<br />
<br />
One potential issue with the scene is that it doesn't provide much context or backstory for the characters or their relationship. While it's clear that there is some kind of romantic or celebratory event happening, we don't know why Yorkie and Kelly are dressed in wedding attire or why they are driving along a deserted road. It would be helpful to provide more information earlier in the script to establish who these characters are and what their motivations are.<br />
<br />
Another area that could be improved is the pacing of the scene. While the dialogue is well-written, there is a lot of it, and the scene might benefit from some additional visual elements or action to break it up and keep the audience engaged. For example, instead of simply describing the tin cans bouncing off the road, we could see a shot of the car from behind as it drives away, with the cans bouncing and sparking in the headlights.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a strong scene that showcases the writer's skill at capturing natural dialogue and creating a sense of atmosphere. With a few tweaks to pacing and context, it could be even stronger.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             Here are some suggestions to improve the scene:<br />
<br />
1. Add more description to set the scene. What does the side of the road look like? Is it dark and isolated, or are there other cars passing by? Where are they driving to?<br />
<br />
2. Utilize more sensory language. What does the air smell like? Are there any sounds besides the LL Cool J song?<br />
<br />
3. Develop the relationship between Kelly and Yorkie more. Why are they dressing up in wedding dresses and putting a bow on Kelly's car? Do they have romantic feelings for each other, or is this just a fun, quirky thing between friends?<br />
<br />
4. Consider adding more conflict or tension to the scene. Right now, it comes across as light-hearted and fun, but it might benefit from some added stakes or obstacles.<br />
<br />
5. Make the tin cans bouncing off the road more significant. Is this a tradition that holds meaning for Kelly and Yorkie, or is it just a silly addition to their wedding attire? Either way, add more weight to the cans to make them an important element of the scene.</p>

She turns round and kisses Kelly. Then jumps off the hood and<br />
starts dancing in the dirt.<br />

She does a cartwheel and ends up looking out into the night.<br />
The wind blowing through her hair.<br />

Kelly tenses up.<br />

She gestures around. Then she raps the hood of the car again,<br />
insistently.<br />

             (rapping hood)<br />
          Touch it.<br />

Kelly gets off the car, starts heading for the driver&#039;s door.<br />

                       KELLY<br />
          I&#039;m going.<br />

Yorkie grabs her arms, turns her around. She takes Kelly&#039;s<br />

She holds gestures to the wedding ring on her finger,<br />

          Not so kind to leave.<br />

Kelly breaks off.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT&#039;D)<br />
          Look, I’m sorry but -- I’ve got<br />

          I want to share it with you.<br />

Kelly is heading back to the car<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          I said I made my choice.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          What is it? What, you feel bad<br />
          &#039;cause your husband isn&#039;t here?<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Don’t.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Well that was his choice. He chose<br />
          to turn this down-<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Please--<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          It&#039;s like he left you. I mean he<br />
          could&#039;ve passed over here but, no --<br />
          he left you.<br />
<br />
That makes Kelly instantly angry. Hard to control it.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re saying.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          You should be mad at him, not<br />
          whipping yourself with guilt--<br />
<br />
Yorkie goes to take her hand again.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Get off me.<br />
<br />
Yorkie tries to pull her back<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          You can’t see it - what he did, it<br />
          was selfish, actually--<br />
<br />
Kelly slaps her. Yorkie holds her cheek, shocked.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a silence. Then:<br />

          Forty nine years. I was with him<br />
          for forty nine years. You can&#039;t<br />
          begin to imagine -- you can&#039;t know -<br />

<br />
She&#039;s letting it all out.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          The bond. The commitment. The<br />
          boredom. The yearning. The<br />
          laughter. The love of it. The<br />
          fucking love. You just cannot know.<br />
          Everything we sacrificed. The years<br />
          I gave him, the years he gave me.<br />
          Did you think to ask? Did it occur<br />
          to you to ask?<br />
<br />
Yorkie is silenced. Kelly is increasingly emotional, and<br />
angry.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          We had a daughter. Alison. Always<br />
          difficult, always beautiful. Died<br />
          at 39 years old, bless her heart,<br />
          and Richard and I, we felt that<br />
          heartbreak as one. You think you&#039;re<br />
          the only person ever suffered, go<br />
          fuck yourself.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I didn&#039;t know--<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Didn&#039;t think to. Y&#039;know when he was<br />
          dying Rich said to me -- when they<br />
          offered him this, to pass over,<br />
          pass through, serve eternity in<br />
          this fucking graveyard you&#039;re so in<br />
          love with -- he said how can I?<br />
          When she missed out, how can I? And<br />
          so he went.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          And I wish I could believe he&#039;s<br />
          with her now, they&#039;re together, but<br />
          I don&#039;t. I believe they&#039;re nowhere.<br />

<br />
Yorkie goes to embrace her, but Kelly physically pushes her<br />
away.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          No. I pitied you and that&#039;s the<br />
          truth. I pitied you. And now you<br />

     She pushes Yorkie aside -- jumps in the car, guns the engine.<br />
<br />

               Kelly, I&#039;m sorry --<br />

     But it&#039;s too late. Kelly roars away.<br />

57   I/E. KELLY&#039;S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                 57<br />
<br />
     Crying, Kelly roars along the highway at full throttle. The<br />
     clock on the dash reads 11:58. She&#039;s flying at full speed.<br />
     &#039;Just Married&#039; cans sparking furiously against the tarmac.<br />
<br />
     She swerves around a corner, narrowly avoiding a set of<br />
     headlights. Slams her foot harder on the accelerator.<br />
<br />
     Up ahead, a section of road gives way to a drop. Before it<br />
     are a set of concrete bollards.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at this. Aims the car right for it.<br />
<br />
     The car thumps into the bollards. Dead stop. Glass fragments<br />
     spray around Kelly as she flies through the windshield like a<br />
     rag doll fired from a cannon.<br />
<br />
     She skids across the tarmac and comes to a halt in the centre<br />
     of the road, a broken heap.<br />
<br />
     She lies still for a moment. All is silent.<br />
<br />
     Then slowly, she sits up. She&#039;s dusty -- but physically<br />
     unharmed. She looks up at the night sky. At the moon.<br />
<br />
     Then a hand reaches down to help her up.<br />
<br />
     She looks round. It&#039;s Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at the outstretched hand. Looks up at Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     The clock on the dash clicks to midnight.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie stands alone in the middle of the road.<br />

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	Overall, this is a well-written and emotionally charged scene. The tension builds gradually as Yorkie tries to persuade Kelly to join her in San Junipero, and Kelly's anger reaches a boiling point when Yorkie suggests that her deceased husband made a selfish decision by not passing over. The dialogue is realistic and reveals the characters' motivations and backstories effectively.<br />
<br />
One potential critique is that the scene may feel too heavy-handed and melodramatic to some viewers. The emotional outburst from Kelly may seem slightly over the top, and the choice for her to drive her car into the bollards feels a bit contrived. However, this is ultimately a matter of personal taste and the scene's impact will depend on the individual viewer.<br />
<br />
Another potential critique is that the scene could benefit from more visual description to enhance the setting and the characters' movements. For example, the dirt that Yorkie dances on could be described in more detail to give a clearer sense of the environment, and Kelly's physical actions during her outburst could also be more vividly described.<br />
<br />
Overall, while the scene may have some minor flaws, it effectively conveys the emotional turmoil of the characters and sets up the rest of the story.</p>

             The scene could benefit from some more character development leading up to this moment. It appears that Kelly's anger and outburst may be out of character if we don't know her backstory and history, particularly with her daughter's death. It may also be beneficial to show more of Yorkie's struggle in her past life before passing over to San Junipero. Additionally, the dialogue could be tightened and made more concise, as it feels somewhat repetitive in places.

She does a cartwheel and ends up looking out into the night.<br />
The wind blowing through her hair.<br />
<br />
                     YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
             (quieter)<br />

                    YORKIE<br />
          Yeah but now I live here.<br />
<br />
She turns to look at Kelly, smiling.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
          Be with me.<br />

                    YORKIE<br />
          That&#039;s not what I mean.<br />

Kelly tenses up.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
          Pass over. When you&#039;re ready, when<br />

          It&#039;s ten to midnight, you&#039;re out of<br />

          Then you&#039;ll be gone, just gone. You<br />

          It&#039;s not a trap, it&#039;s -- look at<br />

She gestures around. Then she raps the hood of the car again,<br />
insistently.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
             (rapping hood)<br />
          Touch it.<br />
<br />
Kelly gets off the car, starts heading for the driver&#039;s door.<br />
<br />
                       KELLY<br />
          I&#039;m going.<br />

Yorkie grabs her arms, turns her around. She takes Kelly&#039;s<br />
hands and puts them on her own (Yorkie&#039;s) face.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />

<br />
She holds gestures to the wedding ring on her finger,<br />
smiling.<br />

                       YORKIE (CONT’D)<br />
          Uh-huh?<br />

                    YORKIE<br />
          Not so kind to leave.<br />
<br />
Kelly breaks off.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE (CONT&#039;D)<br />
          Look, I’m sorry but -- I’ve got<br />
          this chance, we got this chance --<br />
          I want to share it with you.<br />
<br />
Kelly is heading back to the car<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          I said I made my choice.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          What is it? What, you feel bad<br />
          &#039;cause your husband isn&#039;t here?<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Don’t.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          Well that was his choice. He chose<br />
          to turn this down-<br />
<br />
                     KELLY<br />
          Please--<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          It&#039;s like he left you. I mean he<br />
          could&#039;ve passed over here but, no --<br />
          he left you.<br />
<br />
That makes Kelly instantly angry. Hard to control it.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          You don&#039;t know what you&#039;re saying.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          You should be mad at him, not<br />
          whipping yourself with guilt--<br />
<br />
Yorkie goes to take her hand again.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Get off me.<br />
<br />
Yorkie tries to pull her back<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          You can’t see it - what he did, it<br />
          was selfish, actually--<br />
<br />
Kelly slaps her. Yorkie holds her cheek, shocked.<br />
<br />
There&#039;s a silence. Then:<br />

          Forty nine years. I was with him<br />
          for forty nine years. You can&#039;t<br />
          begin to imagine -- you can&#039;t know -<br />
          -<br />
<br />
She&#039;s letting it all out.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          The bond. The commitment. The<br />
          boredom. The yearning. The<br />
          laughter. The love of it. The<br />
          fucking love. You just cannot know.<br />
          Everything we sacrificed. The years<br />
          I gave him, the years he gave me.<br />
          Did you think to ask? Did it occur<br />
          to you to ask?<br />
<br />
Yorkie is silenced. Kelly is increasingly emotional, and<br />
angry.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          We had a daughter. Alison. Always<br />
          difficult, always beautiful. Died<br />
          at 39 years old, bless her heart,<br />
          and Richard and I, we felt that<br />
          heartbreak as one. You think you&#039;re<br />
          the only person ever suffered, go<br />
          fuck yourself.<br />
<br />
                    YORKIE<br />
          I didn&#039;t know--<br />
<br />
                    KELLY<br />
          Didn&#039;t think to. Y&#039;know when he was<br />
          dying Rich said to me -- when they<br />
          offered him this, to pass over,<br />
          pass through, serve eternity in<br />
          this fucking graveyard you&#039;re so in<br />
          love with -- he said how can I?<br />
          When she missed out, how can I? And<br />
          so he went.<br />
             (beat)<br />
          And I wish I could believe he&#039;s<br />
          with her now, they&#039;re together, but<br />
          I don&#039;t. I believe they&#039;re nowhere.<br />
          Like you said, gone. Just gone.<br />
<br />
Yorkie goes to embrace her, but Kelly physically pushes her<br />
away.<br />
<br />
                    KELLY (CONT’D)<br />
          No. I pitied you and that&#039;s the<br />
          truth. I pitied you. And now you<br />
          give me some sales pitch about how<br />
          fuckin&#039; peachy &#039;forever&#039; could be..<br />

               You want to spend forever<br />
               somewhere nothing matters? End up<br />
               like Wes; all those... lost fucks<br />
               at the Quagmire, trying anything<br />
               just to feel something? Go ahead.<br />
               But I’m out. I’m gone.<br />
<br />
     She pushes Yorkie aside -- jumps in the car, guns the engine.<br />
<br />
                         YORKIE<br />
               Kelly, I&#039;m sorry --<br />
<br />
     But it&#039;s too late. Kelly roars away.<br />
<br />
<br />
57   I/E. KELLY&#039;S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                 57<br />
<br />
     Crying, Kelly roars along the highway at full throttle. The<br />
     clock on the dash reads 11:58. She&#039;s flying at full speed.<br />
     &#039;Just Married&#039; cans sparking furiously against the tarmac.<br />
<br />
     She swerves around a corner, narrowly avoiding a set of<br />
     headlights. Slams her foot harder on the accelerator.<br />
<br />
     Up ahead, a section of road gives way to a drop. Before it<br />
     are a set of concrete bollards.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at this. Aims the car right for it.<br />
<br />
     The car thumps into the bollards. Dead stop. Glass fragments<br />
     spray around Kelly as she flies through the windshield like a<br />
     rag doll fired from a cannon.<br />
<br />
     She skids across the tarmac and comes to a halt in the centre<br />
     of the road, a broken heap.<br />
<br />
     She lies still for a moment. All is silent.<br />
<br />
     Then slowly, she sits up. She&#039;s dusty -- but physically<br />
     unharmed. She looks up at the night sky. At the moon.<br />
<br />
     Then a hand reaches down to help her up.<br />
<br />
     She looks round. It&#039;s Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     Kelly looks at the outstretched hand. Looks up at Yorkie.<br />
<br />
     The clock on the dash clicks to midnight.<br />
<br />
     Yorkie stands alone in the middle of the road.<br />

<br />
     Elder Kelly, sitting in a chair, suddenly lurches forward<br />
     slightly, as though rousing from a dream. She reaches for the<br />
     &#039;connector&#039; nodules on her temples and takes them off.<br />
<br />
     In the corner of the room sits Laura, asleep with an e-book<br />
     on her lap.<br />
<br />
     Elder Kelly rubs her eyes a little. Leans back against her<br />
     chair and sighs.<br />
<br />

     Yorkie, alone, is walking along the middle of the road. She<br />
     looks up at the sky.<br />

     We fade out. Then fade up on:<br />

<br />
60   EXT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - MORNING                   60<br />
<br />
     Time has passed. Bright, burning sunlight glints off the<br />
     walls of the Sienna Trust nursing home.<br />
<br />
<br />
61   INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - DAY                       61<br />
<br />
     Elder Kelly sits in a main lounge area. An oxygen tank<br />
     attached to her nostrils.<br />
<br />
     At other tables there are seniors playing dominos. Staring at<br />
     the walls.<br />
<br />
<br />
62   INT. SIENNA TRUST ASSISTED LIVING - DAY                       62<br />
<br />
     In her room, Elder Kelly is having another coughing fit.<br />
     Painful, sharp. It comes to an end. Laura rubs her back.<br />
<br />

     peace.<br />

	Overall, the scene is well-written with a clear sense of emotion and a strong visual component. The use of Belinda Carlisle's "Heaven is a Place on Earth" as a motif throughout the scene is a nice touch that reinforces the theme of chasing after paradise. <br />
<br />
However, there are a few areas that could be improved. For example, the use of "indistinct" for Elder Kelly's dialogue is not entirely clear and could be more specific. Additionally, some descriptions could benefit from more sensory detail, such as the burning sunlight reflecting off the walls in scene 60. <br />
<br />
There is also some ambiguity in the scene where Laura is confused by Kelly's comment about being ready for "the rest of it." While this confusion could be intentional, it could benefit from some clarification or added context. <br />

Overall, the scene is emotionally impactful and visually engaging, but could benefit from minor revisions.</p>

             Overall, the scene seems to flow well and provide a sense of closure for the story. However, here are some suggestions to enhance the scene:<br />
<br />
- Add more emotional depth to Elder Kelly's scenes in the nursing home. It would be powerful to see her interact with other residents and staff, and to witness the toll that her illness is taking on her body and mind. This would make her final moments feel more impactful and earned.<br />
- Consider incorporating more symbolism or visual cues to represent the transition to San Junipero. For example, we see Yorkie driving a car and Kelly lying in a hospital bed with nodules on her temples, but could there be other subtle hints or foreshadowing that build towards the reveal?<br />
- Clarify the timeline a bit more clearly. Although there are hints to indicate when certain scenes take place (e.g. the cassette tape and the gravestone), it may be helpful to explicitly state how much time has passed between each scene. This would help the audience feel more invested in the characters and their journey.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Critique</h4><br/>
	As an AI language model, I am not an expert in screenwriting. However, I can provide some feedback. <br />
<br />
The first scene appears to be a flashback to 1987 with Kelly and Yorkie on the dance floor. The use of "1987 gear" helps set the tone and the atmosphere for the scene. The song choice, Belinda Carlisle's "Heaven is a Place on Earth," helps to connect the moment with the overall theme of the episode. <br />
<br />
However, as a standalone scene, it doesn't appear to add much to the episode's plot or character development. While it is nice to see Kelly and Yorkie together, the scene doesn't advance the story. <br />
<br />
The second scene, in contrast, seems to be disconnected from the first. It appears to be a completely different scene taking place in a server room. The only connection seems to be the use of the same song. <br />
<br />
Overall, while the individual scenes may be well-executed, as a unit, they don't appear to be cohesive or contribute much to the overall episode. A screenwriting expert may suggest that the scenes need to be more tightly woven together, either through thematic links or plot development.</p>

             <p> <center><h4>Suggestions</h4><br/>
             As a screenwriting AI, I suggest the following revisions:<br />
<br />
1. Develop the character of Kelly and Yorkie a bit more, so the audience can connect with them emotionally. Add a backstory or create some conflict for them to overcome.<br />
<br />
2. Create a more dynamic scene on the dance floor. Instead of just dancing and embracing, give them something to do or say that adds to their relationship.<br />
<br />
3. Consider using a different song lyric for the scene in the server room, something that adds to the tension or excitement of the moment.<br />
<br />
4. Consider adding a more visually interesting image to the final shot, rather than just focusing on the flickering blue LEDs. This will make the scene more memorable for the audience.</p>
